It could happen.  All we have to do is annex Washington state from the US, and boom, Seattle is ours.  Just a few short weeks after Seattle being acquired by Canada; Holly and I would move on down and live the life of Seattleites.

I'm not sure exactly how it would happen.  Maybe we could trade the US part or all of Quebec for Washington state.  I mean, Quebec keeps saying that it doesn't want to be a part of Canada so it could just work.  Not to mention that with the acquisition of Seattle, Canada would be where both Starbucks and Tim Horton's were founded.  How cool would that be?

This just in: Canada - Coffee Capital of the World!

Speaking of coffee, the next time that Holly and I are down in Seattle I'm going to take a picture of her at the original<sup><a href="#aside">[1]</a></sup> Starbucks shop.  She's a bonafide coffee addict<sup><a href="#addict">[2]</a></sup>, so it only seems fitting.

Of course living in Seattle would present certain life challenges.  You see, it would be impossible not to gain weight when the likes of Dahlia Lounge, Dahlia Bakery, Lola and Serious Pie<sup><a href="#serious">[3]</a></sup> are around.

This doesn't even start to bring places like Racha Thai or Top Pot Doughnuts into the equation.  Now don't get me wrong, I'm willing to accept the challenge of eating all of that wonderul food on a regular basis.  It would be a lot like how Holly and I eat now when we are at home, but with a lot less work for Holly and a lot fewer dishes for me.

Having a romantic dinner with Holly at Dahlia Lounge is one of the best experiences in the world.

<a name="aside">[1]</a> : Okay, okay, it isn't quite the original Starbucks location.  It has moved about a block from the original spot in Pike's Place Market.  Just in case there is a coffee history nazi out there reading this.

<a name="addict">[2]</a> : 6+ cups a day!

<a name="serious">[3]</a> : Seriously, the best pizza pie you can find.
