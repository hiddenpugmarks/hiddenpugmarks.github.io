The time to move keeps drawing closer and closer.  I&apos;ve started looking at some condos and apartments online.  I&apos;m really looking for something right downtown in Montreal and right along the metro line.  Preferrably along the orange line.

There is a new set of loft apartments opening up in downtown Montreal that look amazing!  I&apos;m sure there is no way I can afford one though :(  I will definitely look into it though, becauase wow, did I mention they are amazing?

My ticket out of hell got pushed back to Monday because the movers decided that they can&apos;t move my stuff (I call it junk, the movers call it stuff) on Thursday or Friday so it will have to be Saturday morning.  One more day for a life time away?  I guess that&apos;s an okay deal.

I&apos;ve been slacking.  Maybe even super-slacking on cleaning up my apartment.  Maybe I&apos;ll just let the movers do it when they&apos;re here?  I&apos;ll just tell them what to pack and whatever is left I&apos;ll just throw out.

It&apos;s amazing the crap you can accumulate over the years.  I mean really, excercise bike?  Me?  It worked out great for that first month, now it&apos;s a hat rack.  It&apos;s a nice hat rack though :)
