This week started pretty much as poorly as weeks can start.  My car was broken into.  I guess this is my final rite of initiation into ghetto life.

I have to say that it was just a horrible feeling to get to the car and see that there wasn't a front driver's side window anymore.  Then to look further in and see the contents of the glove compartment scattered all over the car.

The real kicker is that nothing was stolen.  I never keep anything in my car specifically to try and keep it from becoming a target for theft.

In the end it did cost me a full day's pay plus another couple of hundred dollars to replace the window.  Hopefully I won't need to get the electronics in the door rewired too.

I still don't have the window replaced.  That was supposed to happen this morning.  Unfortunately when I was 20 minutes away from the glass place they called me and told me there had been a computer glitch.  They didn't actually have the window available.  The nearest one they could find was in Edmonton and it would take until Friday to get here.  

So I have an appointment for Saturday to get the window replaced.  The guy is nice enough that he's going to come in on his day off to fix it for me.

For the rest of the week I get to drive around with a nice and ugly barely transparent sheet of plastic stuck to my door.  Joy...

All of this makes me miss Holly even more than I already did.  I can't wait until she gets back on Friday night.  I love you Babe.

I'm expecting to be mugged any moment now.
