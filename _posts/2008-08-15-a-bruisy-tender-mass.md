That title pretty much explains my foot, and my current state by extension.  The surface bruising is going away little by little.  I have gone from having a mostly purplish foot, to just a little bit of bruising left in my toes.  Everything is still a little sore, and I'm not walking at anywhere near 100% yet, but it is getting better.

The brace makes a huge difference.  Without the brace on I feel pretty hobbled, and with it on I can walk 80+% of normal.

As for work, I'm starting to feel pretty bruisy there too.  I can't clearly remember the last time that I was anywhere near to being this busy.  It would have been back when I worked for HB and we were seriously understaffed.  I have 60 days of work to do in the next 30 days.  We're trying to get the work load cut down, but we'll see how that goes.  I've been feeling pretty drained at the end of the day lately.

It won't be much longer and Holly and I will be heading away on vacation.  It will be nice to head home and visit the family.  I'm hoping my ankle will be feeling a lot stronger by then.  At the very least I hope to be able to walk normally with the brace on.

I can't wait for the weekend to start.
