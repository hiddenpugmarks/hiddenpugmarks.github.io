Today I turned in the keys for my old place.  I have some great memories of that place.  Memories that I never would have had without meeting Holly.  Lots of laughs, some great times and a few fights.

In one of those wierd twists of life the only thing I really miss about the place is the time I spent there with Holly.  Now of course, I get to spend every night with her.  It is strange to have the near-present become a memory.

We have survived our first week of living together.  The two of us are doing great except for an ever present state of exhaustion and some kitten bites and scratches.  Leo is quite a ferocious little guy when he wants to be.  Even Max joined in on the fun last night and swiped me across the back of the leg.  This is what I get for wearing shorts instead of pants.

There is still quite a bit of settling in and unpacking to be done yet.  Something like eight more boxes of books, movies and games to unpack.  I'm not really happy with the current performance of the home network either.  It seems to be taking about an hour to download 40MB over my Xbox 360.  That just isn't acceptable.  The connection is supposed to be 10MB/s down.  I'll be doing performance tests on it after I get a desk; and setup probably the only computer that will be bound by a wire connection.

Sleep is a precious memory.
