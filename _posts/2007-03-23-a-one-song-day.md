God said it would rain for forty days and forty nights, and that it would destroy every living thing on the earth... except fish.

It feels like it has been raining for the biblical forty days and forty nights, maybe even eighty days, but everything hasn't been destroyed yet. 

The oppressive grey that I once thought was so reverant has begun to weigh heavily on my soul.  I'm sure that once we get a couple of weeks of sunshine I'll feel better, but right now it's terrible.  I have no drive to do anything.  It takes forever to convince myself to leave my bed and longer to leave my apartment for work.  I seriously wanted to call in "grey" today.  That's close to sick right?

All of that adds up to today being a one song day.  What's that song? Alexisonfire - This Could Be Anywhere In The World.  Why a one song day?  The constant nature of one song is soothing in an odd way.

And now I leave you with:

Heavy mist shrouds the mountains
Light droplets fall from the sky
The fire and blue are hidden
Held captive by water up high
Cherry blossoms hang heavy with rain
They bow as though they pray
For the shining source of life
The yellow hidden beyond the grey
- Hidden Pugmarks
