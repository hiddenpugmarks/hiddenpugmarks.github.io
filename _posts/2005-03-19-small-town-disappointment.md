I&apos;m so very disappointed with the small town I live in sometimes.  It&apos;s so hard to get anything done in a place like this when you are used to city life.

Today all I wanted to do was get one page printed out, sign it, and fax it away.  Of course the local printing and faxing shop is conveniently closed every Saturday in the month of March.  WTF?

So I went to the mall.  I went to almost every store that had a computer in it and asked them if I could print a one page document for five bucks.  No where would let me do it.  The closest I got was at a Radio Shack where I tried to tell them that I wanted to test out a printer before I bought it.  I had the guy going for it too until his manager showed up.

So I ended up at the local library internet access point.  Where they told me that their machines were setup so that you couldn&apos;t use the cd-rom drive to do anything from for security reasons.  They told me I could go ahead and try though.  Well, of course they were wrong or maybe their security just really sucks when you are someone who works with computers every single day of your life.

So I managed to get that sheet printed out and signed.  On to phase two.  Get that sucker faxed!  Of course the library couldn&apos;t fax it.  Why?  I have no idea...

So I ended up in a drugstore/post-office outlet (go figure?) and they would fax it for something like $2 a page plus long distance and other crap.  I was like sure, no problem.  I&apos;ve been running around town for two hours dodging hail and incompetence.  What&apos;s a few bucks?

So I filled out the forms and gave her the sheets and let her go at it.  Sure enough it didn&apos;t work.  She just said that it wasn&apos;t working.  It had never made that noise before.  She wasn&apos;t sure what was wrong.  Would I like to try later?  Later!?!  I&apos;m sure she just didn&apos;t know what she was doing and she wouldn&apos;t let me try myself.

So much effort. Two hours of wandering around town, the first part of which was in a hail storm, and nothing to show for it.  Gah!

Lesson learned:

Never go walking in a hail storm. I repeat NEVER go walking in a hail storm.
