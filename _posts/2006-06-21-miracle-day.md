Well, it's that time again.  That time when I have to do the impossible.  That time when I pick up the gargantuan tasks of the projct and rest them firmly on my shoulders.  That time when I dig deep inside and pull a rabbit out of the proverbial hat.

It used to be that I pulled off minor programming feats of a miraculous nature on an almost weekly basis.  It has been a long time since I have had to do such a thing.  I hope that the magic is still in there somewhere.

The hat may have to go on backwards this week.  We all know what that means.

All it takes is one bright point in the sky to save a lost ship.  (Thanks Holly)
