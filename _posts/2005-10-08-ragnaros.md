So I play World of Warcraft.  I play it a lot.  Tonight the raid I go to Molten Core with finally kicked Ragnaros&apos; fiery butt back into the lava!

It was an amazing and thrilling moment.  Such a huge achievement!  40 people working together toward one aim.  The group has been working toward this moment for quite a while and we finally did it.  People were shaking they were so excited by it!

Not bad at all for a pick up group :)
