Part 1 - The Jalopy

I&apos;ve never seen a taxi quite like the one I took to the airport at 4am on Thursday morning.  The only word to describe it is jalopy.  I got in, had a look at the driver, got scared, had a look around the car, got more scared.  Good thing I was so tired.

The car itself had broken seatbelt buckles.  They worked but were missing the covers to the latching mechanisms.  The driver gave me flashbacks to the cop from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  He made lots of strange noises and chain smoked for the whole one hour drive.

There was a strange jangling in the car too.  It took me nearly a half hour of sneaking glances out of the corner of my eye in the eerie green glow of the dashboard lights to notice two little bells hanging from the ceiling.

The car also made noises and behaved a lot like the car in the old John Candy movie Uncle Buck.

Part 2 - When a Man Falls on a Plane

So I completely passed out on the plane from Halifax to Toronto.  One second I was standing in the aisle, the next I was on my back looking up at everyone around me.  I don&apos;t remember the fall at all.  Just the waking up.  Then there was the whole being put on oxygen and I think twenty minutes of them asking me questions and filling out paper work over the whole thing.  

I got bumped up to first class for the rest of the trip though :)

They almost didn&apos;t let me leave the Toronto airport on my connecting flight.  They tried to make me stay until the doctor could look at me.  I told them I had to get there on time and they compromised by letting me just talk to a nurse.  It turns out I was dehydrated, had a slight touch of food poisoning, hadn&apos;t eaten in a few too many hours, didn&apos;t get enough sleep, and it was just ridiculously hot on the plane.  All of those things put together, equals me on the floor of the plane.  Stupid heat!

Part 3 - The Wailing Child

From Toronto to Vancouver, I got stuck on a flight with a child who just could not be calmed down.  Now normally something like that would never bother me.  That day though, wow, did it ever drive me up the wall.  Keep in mind I had passed out on my last flight and had only one hour of sleep the night before.  I really needed to sleep on that flight, but the kid just didn&apos;t quiet down at all.

Part 4 - Oh Sweet Beautiful Ground!

It felt really nice to finally arrive at my destination.  I like flying, but I really like being on the ground.  It just feels so much safer and, well, more solid.  What can I say?  Things don&apos;t fall out of the ground!

I ended up at this really swanky hotel.  Too swanky for me!  The elevators all had crazy different lighting in them.  One was blue and yellow, the other was red and green.  Although that place sure was jumping in the evening :)

Part 5 - Interviews and Offers

The interviews were great.  I&apos;m good at talking and the time sure flew buy.  The offer was outstanding!  Turning it down will be hard to do, and I still might not.  My heart seems to be in Montreal right now though.  It just makes sense in a lot of ways.

Part 6 - When the Old Meets the New

I ran into a couple of good friends out there that I used to work with.  It was great to see them and catch up on old times.  Good to see they were doing well and see how life had changed for the better.

It was fun to go out and grab some late night food too!

Part 7 - The Return (Boy My Head Hurts!)

I had a headache the whole flight back.  I still needed so much sleep, but I couldn&apos;t seem to get to sleep.  Thankfully the played Lemony Snicket and that helped pass the time :)  I love that movie!

Then on the last flight home I watched Spiderman 2 on my PSP.  The PSP just keeps endearing itself to me more and more.

My headache went away something like 30 hours after it started.  I&apos;m so glad that it&apos;s gone now.  I think I was stressed over something.

Part 8 - The Goodness

I just keep getting good news from everywhere and everyone.  It seems like good things are happening to all of the people I know.  It&apos;s a wonderful time right now :)  I&apos;m so ridiculously happy sometimes that I can&apos;t even contain it :)

I just wanted to give a shout out to my friend Ilona.  You were there for me when I needed you these past couple of days.  It means the world to me :)  I hope to repay the favour one day.

Part 9 - The End

I need to sleep more.  I had a really good day so far today.  Now it&apos;s time for big screen gaming and maybe some beer and pizza.

Mmmmm, soft serve rum ice cream :)

There is a giant journey ahead of me.  I can&apos;t wait to get this adventure started!
