I spend all of my time thinking about you
Waking up in the shower
Taking the elevator
Walking in the park
Riding on the metro
Sitting at work
Having lunch
When I&apos;m playing games
Talking with friends
Standing in line at the grocery store
Dreaming at night
Every where I go
Every thing I do
It involves you
In some way you are there
I can never get away
And I never want to
You feel like home
