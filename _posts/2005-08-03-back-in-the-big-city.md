So I&apos;m back, and I&apos;m well.  The wedding was wonderful!  Amanda looked stunning in her dress.  I still haven&apos;t really met her husband, but someday I&apos;m sure we&apos;ll sit down and chat over beer and maybe video games.

The surprise of one of my poems being used in the wedding ceremony was amazing!  That&apos;s one of the best surprises that I&apos;ve ever had.  Hopefully everyone will buy and read the book with my poetry in it now that I can talk about it :)
