Last night I gave out my WoW account information to a friend so that tonight, while I'm out enjoying the sonic bliss of Emm Gryner, they can play my warrior and get me the Legplates of Wrath if they drop.  

I have to say, I felt a little uneasy about giving out my information.  It doesn't even have anything to do with trust.  I do trust them.  I think it's more about a sense of identity.  That avatar is me.  It's always me.  For over a year, countless raids, instances, pvp events, it has been me.  Every piece of armor, every enchant, every potion, every trinket; it's all me.  Tonight though, it won't be.

Tonight when that avatar logs on and the guild says hello or someone whispers me, they aren't getting me.  It's a very surreal thing to me.

I know it's not a big deal for my friend.  They play a half dozen different accounts.  For me, I just play my own.  Sometimes I think it would be nice to have another account so that I could power-level myself.

It looks like there will be 6-10 of us going to the show tonight.  I think it will be a good time.  I may not stick around for the whole thing, but I will definitely hang out until Emm plays.  God that girl can sing!
