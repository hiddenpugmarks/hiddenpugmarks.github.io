So I'm finally done with my Software Engineering Boot Camp.  Thankfully I only had to go to two out of the eight days.  A big thanks goes out to my manager for that!

As horribly boring and uneducational as it was, I still managed to find a couple of unexpected ways to make it tolerable enough to enjoy.

One way was constantly beating one of the other senior guys there who had to take the course.  He does the exact same job as me on a different team and he has about 10 years more experience than I do.  So yeah, fun :)

The second way was finding out that I have "street cred".  The instructor, who is about the number five guy around this company remembered me.  Which is good, because I didn't remember him >.>  Anyway, we were doing this test where they gave us a bunch of broken code.  They gave us about an hour to fix it.  I had it done and tucked away after about 30 minutes and no one else finished it.  Quote from the instructor "Well, I expected YOU to get it."  So that's all good.

I also lucked out and ended up sitting between a couple of interesting people.  Art L. and Jessie Z.  They made it feel like we were the kids who always sit in the back in high school and cause trouble.

It was after the debugging test mentioned above that I came up with the idea of Digital Channeling.  At the end of the class they went through the program and showed all of the corrections that needed to be done and how to fix them.  I honestly couldn't remember which crash was tied to which fix I did for a lot of them.  I just fixed them.  That's just how it works for me.  I look at code and I simply *know* "this is wrong!" and I fix it.  I'm sure that this is just some skill that I have honed to perfection of thousands of hours of programming.  Still, it's interesting.

The Boot Camp has been making me late for my raid group all week.  I was amazed to find out last night when I got home that they hadn't even attempted the two last fights in Blackwing before I arrived.  I thought for sure I was going to miss our second ever Nefarian kill.  However I got to be there for that and finishing Molten Core which marks the first night we have ever finished off Ragnaros, Nefarian, and I believe even Onyxia(I wasn't there, but I think my character did do the tanking...) in a single day.  I think we are finally hitting our stride as one of the best raiding groups on the server.

This weekend I have promised myself that I am going to get serious about unpacking and try to finish it.  I'm getting tired of having boxes all over my place.
