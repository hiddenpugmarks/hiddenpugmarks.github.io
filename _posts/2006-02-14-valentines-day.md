It's Valentine's Day.  Potentiallly one of the most amazing and most depressing days of the year.

For a guy like me, Valentine's Day is the type of day that you live for.  A chance to do all of the little things.  A chance to write and give and try and show someone how much they mean to you.  A day to celebrate love and relationships.

I may have plans tonight.  Sort of...  Maybe...  Hopefully =)

As it is Valentine's Day I feel compelled to write something for it.  That, and I'm sure some people out there expect me to.  Plus, I told someone I would.

<b>To The Girl With No Last Name</b>
<i>I watch you flutter through the sky
Like a forbidden butterfly
A fleeting blur of mottled wonder
Enrapturing all who catch sight of you
With your butterfly kisses
You bring hope to life
Flowers of it blooming along your path
Carrying everyone higher on your wings
When you cross between my eyes and the sun
A bubble of rainbow swirls surrounds you
Almost invisible to everyone
Just barely strong enough to keep them away
You always disappear before it fades
I want to watch it fade some day
Step inside of its boundaries
Really see the heart that beats within
Stand guard over it through the long night
Waiting patiently while the exhaustion ebbs away
Protecting you until the rainbows return
</i>

Happy Valentine's Day everyone!  Don't forget the flowers!
