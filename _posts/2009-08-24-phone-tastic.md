I finally joined the smart phone revolution.  In fact i'm blogging from my phone right now!

No, I didn't get an iPhone.  I looked at them, and yes they are cool, but I like mine even more.  I ended up getting an HTC Magic; one of the phones running Google's Android OS.  It fits well since my life is basically Google-powered anyway.  Everything has worked smoothly and intuitively right out of the box.

Since getting the new phone and literally having the internet at my fingertips I've been going through a phase that I can only compare to when I first got internet access 12 years ago.  I'm up until ridiculously late every night just surfing the web, listening to internet radio and watching YouTube.

It is also my first GPS device.  GPS + internet is very cool and filled with possibilities!  Some of the "augmented reality" applications are very cool.  One example is using the GPS+maps+camera to overlay the map data on top of the live camera image using the GPS data.

Well hopefully this post works :)
