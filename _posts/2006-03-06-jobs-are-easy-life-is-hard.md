It happened!  It dropped!  Not only that, but I won the roll!  After months in Zul'Gurub the epic sword I wanted, Bloodlord's Defender, has finally fallen into my possession.  It's just so amazing!

I hope that this is a sign of things to come.  Hopefully soon I will get my Legplates of Wrath and my Bracers of Might.

In life things are grooving.  I seem to have found the root of my insane headaches that I was having Thursday, Friday and part of Saturday.  Since news on Friday they have faded.  Tonight, I'm supposed to get news about my future.  I guess this is technically The Future: Step 5, where I consider the future to be everything after High School.

Step 1: College
Step 2: University
Step 3: HB Studios
Step 4: Ubisoft
Step 5: ???

I love it when people read my resume.  I always have.  Ever since I hit a certain experience level.  I especially like that they are chronologically reversed.  So people read backwards through: 

- Handles audio for seven platforms over five languages for 35 SKUs solo.
- Technical lead on one of EA Sports' highest ROI projects ever with a small team.
- Did everything on two games.
- Did everything on one game and worked on the port to another platform.
- Dropped out of University.
- Two year diploma in Artificial Intelligence.

If it were listed the other way around people would single in on the "Dropped out of University" part, and that would immediately cloud their judgement on everything else.

Listed as it is people read it and they think: OMG Code Ninja!  We need this guy!  All of a sudden instead of wondering why I dropped out of University they start thinking "He must have been so bored and confined by University."

So, tonight when I know more, if I know more, others will know more.  I hope I know more, and then I can plan the letter...
