I was looking at the NHL 2008 Playoffs leading scorers today, and I stumbled across this very interesting comparison:

Assuming the Penguins and the Red Wings make it to the final against each other, it paints an interesting picture for how things could end up.  The most interesting comparison to make is that the top four players, are the top four players.  Tied for 1st and 3rd respectively.  The huge diffference is the +/-.  The Red Wings' forwards are much more responsible, while still putting up the same number of points.

The Penguins' forwards aslo take a lot more penalties, which will give the Red Wings more time on the power play.

It paints a pretty picture for the Red Wing Faithful out there.
