So I went to check out some more music tonight.  This place wasn&apos;t as nice as the last place.  It was another hole in the wall without a sign as well.  I guess that&apos;s how they do things here.

Basically my friend and I were walking down the street looking for it and it went like this; shop, shop, store, restaurant, brickwall with door, shop, store, shop restaurant; realized we had gone to far; walked back hole in the brickwall.  That was the club.

Now this club was small.  Walking into it and up the steps made me feel like I was in my old junior high.  Going into the actual performance area made me feel like I was at a junior high dance, only worse.  Basically the stage was covered with faded red velvet.  The side walls of the room were covered with faded black velvet.  There were a half dozen tables down each side of the room and the rest was just a big open space.  I guess they were expecting a bunch of people who didn&apos;t ever show up.

There were three bands playing but we only stayed for the first two since the metro closes down a little after midnight and we didn&apos;t want to cab it.

The first act was horrendous.  It was called Alex and Sebastien.  If you ever get a chance to see them, turn in the other direction and run far, far, FAR away.  They opened up with a three, five, eight, twenty minute intro?  I have no idea really.  It sounded so bad it was unending torment.  Then they slipped into a song that made me feel like I was somewhere under the sea with that singing crab from the little mermaid.  Shortly after that one of the guys pulled out a triangle and started playing it, along with the already going bass, keyboards, drums, two violins and guitar.  Then they finally said the only thing that sounded good to my ears at all, that they were only going to play one more song.  Then they jumped into a country song that morphed into a 13 minute medley of waterous torcher that sounded like a giant space whale being bludgeoned to death by cosmic fiddles.

After that a band called Limited Express (Has Gone?) took the stage.  From seeing the three of them on stage, a small Japanese woman and two Japanese guys you would never expect what happened to happen.  From the firs touch of pick to string they three of them just lost it completely!  It was insane!  It was wild!  It was awesome and fun!  For the next 30+ minutes all you could see, hear and feel were these crazy Japanese rockers absolutely blowing the first band out of the water.  The whole place stood up and moved toward the stage.  Feet were tapping, legs were twitching, hands were clapping.  It was like Rammstein (spelling?) only led by a crazy five foot tall Japanese woman.  They were jumping all over the stage, pointing at the crowd, jumping off of the stage, going over and up and down from chairs, screaming like mad and making beautiful metal music.  Someone at the venue noted afterward that they had never seen so many people there with smiles on their faces or so caught up in a show.  If you get a chance to see Limited Express (Has Gone?), just do it.  It&apos;s loud, it&apos;s wild, it will rock you.
