Once upon a time I thought I could be a writer.  I worked at it.  I used to spend entire evenings growing ideas into worlds and characters.  A lot of it was really just therapy for me.

I&apos;ve been wondering if that is something I need to try again?  I&apos;ve been wondering if it is something that I still have in me?  Somewhere deep inside a writer is really all I want to be (aside from the obvious independantly wealthy dream).

Is it worth chasing?  Is it something I can do?  What would I write?

I seem to be missing some direction at the moment.  Where can I find it?

Up until now my goal was always to get out of where I was.  Well, I&apos;m now out of there.  So what&apos;s next?  What is the next goal to go after?

I need to decide.  I need to find out.

Hmm.  Words used to be my friends.  I think I want them to be again.  

Maybe drawing would be something great to get back into as well.  But can I face the demon&apos;s that drawing brings?  Am I willing to return to nightmares every night?

I always thought when I was younger that life would get easy at some point.  I never realised that it was easy then, and it would only get harder from there.  If I had known, my youth would have gone completely differently.  Then again, I&apos;d probably be dead or in jail by now if it had been different, so maybe it wasn&apos;t so bad?

Uggh.  Enough randomness.  

I don&apos;t mind being lost in the real world, sometimes that&apos;s even fun.  Being lost in life though, it eats away at a person.
