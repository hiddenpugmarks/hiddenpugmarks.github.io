I have to say, today started off on a very weird feeling note.  Today was the deadline for deciding if I wanted to renew the lease or terminate it on my apartment.  My lease is up on April 30th.

I went in and asked the building manager if I could have an extension on my lease for a month or two, or if I could just have an extra couple of weeks to make my decision.

They said the best course of action would just be to sign that I didn't want to renew my lease, and then if things happened that made me want to stay I could go back down and tell them that I do want to renew it and sign a new lease.

It felt strange signing that paper saying that I would vacate the premises no later than April 30th.  Mostly because I haven't actually signed a deal yet that gives me a reason to leave.  It was strange to think that this apartment, by far the best one that I have ever had, might not be mine any more.

What will it be like to be in a building in the future that doesn't have an indoor pool on the top floor or a door man?  What would it cost to have these same types of things somewhere else.

Hopefully all will be resolved soon.
