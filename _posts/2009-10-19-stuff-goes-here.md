There is no such thing as free time.  At least not for me.

Work is a use case for insanity these days.  My team is slowly ramping up to five people.  I can't remember the last time it was bigger than two; and that's including me.  Plus it has been about five years since I've been a true lead.  So I'm still readjusting.

I had forgotten how many more meetings you have to go to as a lead as well.  It's just crazy!  You simply can't be productive if you're not at your desk.

Due to all of this I've been much more stressed than I have been since the old HB days.  I need to rediscover the secret to pushing work out of my mind when I walk out of the office.

The scope of this year's project is unparalleled to anything I have ever done in the past and is simply too daunting to be pushed aside.  When something begins to blot out the sun; it's hard not to focus on it.

I can still remember when making video games for a living was fun.  I miss that feeling.  When it was us against the world!  Now it feels more like me against bureaucracy.
