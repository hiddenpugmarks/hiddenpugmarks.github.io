It's raining.  Grey and cold.  Today is one of those days best spent in bed beneath a mountain of blankets away from the world.

One more day until the weekend.  Surely I can make it one more day.  Today has just been one of those days.  Where everything goes wrong and you just wish the day hadn't happened.

I'm so exhausted.  Unfortunately the only time I feel tired enough to sleep is when I'm at work.  Is this just the lingering effects of my bout with food poisoning this week?  I hope so.

There have been a lot of people backing out on or just flat out not helping me lately.  I'm one of those people that when I get it in my head that I'm going to do something, I go all out and do it.  Unfortunately, not everything can be done alone.  No matter how much one might wish it could be.

I think "weary" is the right word to describe me right now.  So tired and weary.

Thankfuly the day is over and it's time to go home now.
