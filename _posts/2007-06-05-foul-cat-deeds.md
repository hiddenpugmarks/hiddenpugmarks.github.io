Last night Holly and I went out to the birthday dinner of one of my best friends.  It was a fun adventure for everyone as we all finally got to meet his new girlfriend.

I have to say that it was all a success.  She seems great for him.  They make a cute couple.

While we were out at the dinner the cats were at home doing truly foul deeds.  By accident of course.  

When we walked in the door the first thing I noticed was that the freezer door was open.  Max, our three year old cat, has decided recently that he really likes to sleep up on the cupboards over top of the refrigerator.  We had just brought home a few groceries the night before.  A lot of these groceries were piled on top of the refrigerator, and this didn't give Max much room up there.  It appears he was probably standing right on the lip of the freezer door when he tried to launch himself up and over everything to his spot on top of the cupboards.

I can see it all very clearly in my head.  That first moment as he hunkers down and tries to push off with his hind legs.  The thrust of his feet pushing open the freezer door.  That first moment of surprise as he realizes that his back half moved further back, instead of his front half moving further up.  And then, the falling.  Dropping backward toward the floor with no control.  That would have bothered Max the most.

Of course, by the time we actually got home everything had already happened.  We were left with a mass of melted and ruined food in the freezer that had to be thrown away and cleaned up.  Melted ice cream bars.  Thawed out black bananas.  It was a chaotic site.  There was a pool of I don't know what, and I hope I never know what, in one of the curved shelves on the door.  It was emitting an absolutely putrid stench.

Hopefully when we get home tonight the freezer door will still be closed.
