This weekend I made some new characters in WoW.  I made two characters that I haven't even logged into yet.  One was a priest and the other was a... dear god, I can't even remember.  The last one was a warrior.

I have to say, I just love being a warrior.  I took my new little guy, a gnome warrior, to level 10 in just over 3 hours.  It was pure fun!  I call him "The Gnome Ninja" because I try to always give him a staff and he has this great spinning finishing move he uses with it.  I'm always going to try and make sure that he has a staff as a two handed weapon, or maybe a polearm in the future.

Some people asked me why I made another warrior, and all I can really come back at them with is "Why not?"  It's just fun.  I know what I'm doing.  I really enjoy the "in your face" kind of action.  One day he will be a feared little DPS(Damage Per Second) gnome.  I've been thinking that after I hit 20 I might level him flagged for PvP.

I'm going to twink (give all the best available gear and advantages) him out.  For example, I'm going to get him so many stamina enchantments that he will have more than double his current health.  He will be an unstoppable force!

Completely unrelated, I'll be going to see Emm Gryner on February 22nd, 2006.  Non-negotiable.  Come Hell or high water.  If I walk away still able to think and speak I might try and do a review of it like I did for Finch a while back.  Although, since getting to see and listen to Emm play live is so close to a religious experience for me I might wrap it up with the single word "wow".
