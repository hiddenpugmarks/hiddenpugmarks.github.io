The streak keeps on keeping on.  My first couch arrived this weekend and, well, it wouldn&apos;t fit in the elevator.  It was 3 inches too long!  What are the odds?

To top it off about an hour after the delivery guys left I found out that there was one elevator that had a ceiling that was a few inches higher, so it might have fit.  Since it has been returned now though they won&apos;t try and re-deliver it. 

So, I have to pick out a new shorter couch from the ones available at the store.  Unfortunately the one I picked was the only one I really liked there.  It&apos;s hard to find a kick-ass navy blue couch for some reason.

I have my fingers crossed that my other couch will fit when it arrives.  It&apos;s almost time to get curtains as well.  Woot!

The place is coming together and looking better with each thing that gets added.  Hopefully by the end of July everything will be in place and then maybe I&apos;ll have a party!

I think Ilona is happy right now, that&apos;s so cool :)  I love it when my friends are happy :)  We have one of those long deep talks coming up, just giving you a warning :)

A congratulations goes out to my friend Lindsay and her new status as a successful triathlete!  That kicks butt!

For Amanda, I&apos;ll get to your wedding somehow.  I mean, how could I miss it?  I want to be there for all of the big days :)

For anyone else who might read this have a lovely day/week/month/year/life!  Hope is all we have sometimes, never give up on it all :)

Oh yeah, I like smileys ;)
