Life is busy.  Life is crazy.  Life is always changing.  Opportunities have been coming at me from all directions lately.  That's my life.  That's the roller coaster.

This time the roller coaster is a two-seater though.  It moves a little differently.  There is a lot more at risk than in the past.  It is both scarier and more exciting at the same time.  There's someone to share it all with :)

This weekend I'm heading out of town for some meetings.  It worked out kind of well.  I'm going away while Holly is away with her Girl Guide Troop on a camping trip.

The meetings could drastically change the near future of our lives.  Nothing is ever final until it actually happens of course.  Is that vague enough?

I am both looking forward to and dreading the trip.  I'm not a big fan of flying.  Planes aren't quite spacious enough for my liking.  I especially dislike it when I'm jammed in the middle of a couple of people.

Of interest is the fact that I arrive at my destination about five hours before I can check in to my hotel.  This is too bad because I'd love to just hole-up in the room and study.  You just can't study too much.  I could also use some sleep.  I just can't seem to get enough of it lately.  Too much burning the candle at both ends.

Today I ended up sleeping in.  Apparently Holly had come in a couple of times to try and wake me up and I just slept through it.  I will say that it adds up fast.  That, being the lack of sleep.

I still haven't found a groove that fits since moving.  Both of us have been pretty tired since moving in together.  We get up on her schedule and we go to bed on mine.  That's a solid 7am-Midnight+ day every day.  Those days don't tend to have much downtime either.

We were remarking over dinner last night that we couldn't remember the last time that we just had a weekend to ourselves when we didn't have something that had to be done.  This weekend is no different since we will both be going away.

Next weekend we were supposed to have a get together.  Finally invite some friends over to see the place and how it has changed as we merge our things together.  It looks like we are probably going to postpone it though.  We need that weekend of rest.

Of course, the stress of everything going on hasn't helped much with sleep.  What would it mean to move again?  I am a restless wanderer.  Traditionally I have never stayed anywhere for very long.  I do know that I want to someday though.  I want to stop and settle.  Plant some roots.  

I know that in Holly I've found the woman that I want to spend my life with.  I just don't know if I'm at the location that I want to live my life.  I guess you could say that, in itself, is the answer.  Things rarely tend to be so simple as to have such simple answers though.

I am going to miss Holly this weekend.  Tonight will be the first night since we moved in together that we won't both be home.  It will be my first bit of time alone at the apartment.  I hope she has a great time this weekend.
