I don't particularly like math, but I toy with it sometimes.  For example, I toy with it when it comes to money.  

I was playing with the numbers for the salary at my new job.  My Gross pay is increasing by ~11%.  Interestingly, and quite astonishingly to me at least, my Net pay is increasing by ~18%.  

This is what I call a win-super win situation.
