I saw the aftermath of a terrible car accident on the way to work.  Right outside of the Burrard SkyTrain station.  They had Burrard Street completely blocked off near there.  Even to bus traffic.

From the looks of it I would guess that someone definitely lost their life in it.  The car looked like a crushed aluminum can.  The top had been cut off to get the occupants out.

I truly hope that everyone survived.

There is nothing quite like witnessing the after effects of, or being a part of, a disaster, no matter the scale, to help bring into focus exactly what your priorities in life are.
