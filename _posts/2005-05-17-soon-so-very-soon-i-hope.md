Finally!  All of my stuff is going to be coming back to me.  I get the internet and cable hooked up tonight.  Tomorrow I get my computers and tvs back :)  I can&apos;t wait to be back and touch with the part of the world that I have been missing.

I got my first piece of mail at my new apartment.  The official invitation to my oldest and probably best friends wedding.  I still need to find someone to go with me.  I know it will be fun.  There are a couple of people that I&apos;m thinking of asking, but I expect that the will say no.  Still, it never hurts to ask.

Now it&apos;s furniture buying time!  I need all kinds of furniture.  Couches, bed, shelves, projector(is that technically furniture?), and more and more.  Maybe I&apos;ll even by a kitchen table and some chairs.  Oh, and a BBQ, definitely need one of those.

Smile everybody!  Life is good :)
