*Acapella*
It&apos;s Friday,
The night is near,
*pata pata *pause* pata pata *pause* (here come the drums)*
It&apos;s Friday,
We celebrate with beer
*beat beat beat beat*
The friends are gathering,
The covers are being paid,
The music will be wild tonight,
And so will everyone around it,
*dun dun duuuunh dun dun duuuunh (the rythm of the Bass)*
Fill your glass again,
Get ready to raise it high,
We&apos;re going to party,
We&apos;re going to party tonight,
*(the guitar comes crashing in with a courageous riff)*
The clinks are heard all around,
Glasses touch glasses aloud,
With unstoppable smiles,
And beautifully twinkling eyes,
The party takes off,
It all starts at 5!
*music stops*
