Holly spoils me so wonderfully.  Today for breakfast, before I had to head off to work, she made me french toast from sourdough bread and an amazing cup of cocoa to go with it.  Then she sent me off to work with a box of Girl Guide cookies.  

You just have to love the perks of dating a Girl Guide leader :)
