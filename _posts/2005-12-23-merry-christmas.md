Merry Christmas and Happy New Year everybody!  Have fun and stay safe!

You&apos;re Christmas/Birthday present is going to be late Ilona.  Amazon.com wouldn&apos;t let me send what I wanted to as a gift to you so I&apos;m doing something else.  Unfortunately I won&apos;t have time to get it together until I get back in early January.

Woo!  No work today and I&apos;m going home for Christmas!  Can it get any better than that?  Well, maybe if I buy one of those Christmas Santa hats it would be better, yeah, that would be better!  Time to go buy one :)

2005 is almost done and gone.  I&apos;ll do retrospective on the year later on; maybe early next year.
