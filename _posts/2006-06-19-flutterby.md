Infectious smiling.  Unavoidable.  Undeniable.  Purely enjoyable.

Butterflys fluttering gently around the insides.  Landing and flapping happily.

Work unbearably mundane when compared to the possibility of life.

Hope so heavy.  Weightier than water.  Deadlier than danger.

Intensely interesting.  Unbelievably unique.

I wish to know so much more.
