Well, although so much has gone wrong since I got to Montreal, I&apos;m still happy to be here.  Things better start looking up soon though, or that could change.

I tried to buy a bed and some other furniture from Sears.  They used my old address when they tried to verify everything with my credit card company (even though I had already updated my address information with Sears).  So my credit card company flagged it and stopped the payment along with locking out my credit card.  Neither company bothered to tell me though.  I found out when I called to see why my bed didn&apos;t get delivered.

So I got that sorted out, but it takes two weeks for Sears to reverse the charge to my credit card, which means I don&apos;t have any room on it to buy anything for a couple of weeks.  So just another delay towards settling in.

Then when I went back to the place that the company here set me up with temporarily, none of my stuff was there.  They assure me that the maid only found socks when she went and cleaned the place up.  Although that still means that they at least admit to taking my socks.  Out of that whole thing I lost three hockey jerseys and a bunch of other stuff.  I&apos;m really only upset about the jersey&apos;s though.  I told them I wasn&apos;t sure what the next step to solve this problem was, but that if I didn&apos;t hear anything from them I would tell the company what had happened.  So now they are investigating everyone who had a key to access the room and they said they will get back to me.

Pretty sucky still!

I had a "Management Meeting" today.  We all went out for expensive italian food and then headed to the movie theatre to watch Madagascar.  I love getting paid to do things like that :)

I have a very nice couch arriving near the end of June.  It pretty much all seems to work out that I will basically be furnitureless until the start of July.  It&apos;s a good thing I can sleep anywhere.  A lot of people would have a problem sleeping on an air mattress for so long I think.

I still have lots of things to unpack, of course with no furniture, I have nowhere to unpack too :P  Sort of a conundrum.  The kitchen is unpacked at least.  

I do have a computer desk at the very least.  Though I&apos;m using a lawn chair with it at the moment.  I&apos;m always amazed how things can change so much and still stay the same.

I&apos;m going to go see Star Wars again tomorrow :)

Water polo anyone?
