Yesterday was kind of a sad day.  Meghan resigned from the guild/raid in World of Warcraft.  

It reminded me of when I stopped playing Ragnarok Online.  Ilona quit, Jeff quit, Kim quit, I got really bored because none of my close friends were still playing, and then I quit.  I didn't even so much quit, as I just sort of drifted away from it.  After they were all gone, other things were just more fun.

I guess I'll see how things fall out.  I don't really have anything keeping me in the guild at this point.  The beating heart and soul of the guild is gone now.  I really only joined and brought a few others over because I knew it was something that Meghan always wanted.  I am an "officer" of the guild, but I'm not actually involved in any decision making.

I have heard others say that they would leave if Meghan left.  So I'll see how many people are left in a week.  Maybe I'll go back to Affinity.  Maybe I'll go back to Soldiers of Ragnarok.  There are probably like three people left in those guilds.  

I think there are still about a dozen people in Soldiers of Ragnarok in iRO.  At least there were last time I checked in on everyone.

I had some good times in iRO =)  People used to stop and stare in awe as SoR rolled through the dungeons.  Nothing could stop us in our prime.  We were one of the only guilds that even tried to take on the world bosses.  I can remember one night we were rolling through the big undead instance, which then was probably the hardest in the game, and people kept saying how they had never seen anything like that before.  Even priests wanted to be in our guild.

There was a limit in iRO as to how many people could be in a guild.  We always had a pretty steady flow of people wanting to join.  Guild membership had a sense of pride to it.  It was so much more special because it was limited.  There was no room for alts (which we got around by having a few seperate guilds like Merchants of Ragnarok).  It was also special to someone new to the guild, because they knew they beat out a bunch of other people to get in.

I've never found that feeling again since.

I have been mulling the idea of quitting WoW over for a long time.  There hasn't really been any single contributing factor to it.  Just lots of little things adding up:
- The rep grinding is tedious and boring.  
- The direction that the raid is heading I don't really agree with.  Mostly because I don't enjoy AQ40.  I believe there is one upgrade item in there for me.  There are a couple of other items that are like 0.001% or 0.002% better than what I currently have.  Hardly worth the effort.  
- Work is going to be getting a lot more demanding between now and September.
- I have more and more of my friends heading out to Vancouver.
- A few other things...

But hey, maybe it's just time for me to take a break again.  I've had a couple of one month breaks in the past.

At the same time, I don't want to quit.  It's cheap entertainment(fifty cents a day) that fills my days and nights with fun most of the time (although the fun factor will be significantly diminished now I think, at least for a while).  At some point I know I will need to really step back and re-evaluate my life and where things fit into it (tends to happen around September and December/January of each year).

Maybe this will all pass in a couple of weeks.  I honestly don't know what I would do to fill my time if I quit playing WoW.  I think that I used to write, and play other games.  I seem to remember spending time in the big blue room with the bright shiny orb at the top and the living green rug once in a while as well.
