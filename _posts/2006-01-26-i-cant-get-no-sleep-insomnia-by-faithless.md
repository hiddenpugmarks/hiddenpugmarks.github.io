I just could not sleep last night.  I tried my bed.  I played some WoW.  I tried my comfy couch.  I played some WoW.  I tried another couch.  I tried my last couch.  I played some WoW &gt;.&gt;

I listened to music.  I installed development software and did some programming.  I surfed the web.  I counted sheep.  I threatened myself with digging out the dreaded dragon book.  (All of you Comp. Sci majors know what I&apos;m talking about)

Eventually, sometime between 3:30 am and 4:00 am I just passed out on my bed.  I woke up at 7:00 am.  Thought "Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"!  Coaxed myself back into dream land.  Fought a losing battle with trying to sleep until a little after 8:00 am.

So yeah, I&apos;m functioning on around 4 hours of sleep.  Oddly I feel better than I do most of the time after 6-12 hours.  I hope I can make it through the day and through the raid to Blackwing Lair tonight.

At least this morning, as I sat up on the edge of my bed, I figured out why I couldn&apos;t sleep.  At least, I think I did.  I think it&apos;s the same problem I was having with sleep last week, only augmented.

*Shakes fist at air and jokingly curses* Damn you feelings!  Damn you!

All is teh gruvy now that I understand.  No one else does, but I do.
