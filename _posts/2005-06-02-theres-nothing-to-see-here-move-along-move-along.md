Come and wake me up
Just kiss me
Like angels&apos; breath
So softly
When my eyes open
I&apos;ll touch your cheek
And I&apos;ll wonder
While I feel so weak
A smile will spread
Across my waking lips
As I struggle to remember
Why I deserve this
I will pull you close
Place my arms around you
Watch the sun in your eyes
And try to believe this is true
And with a pinch
One that feels so mean
I will hurt myself
To test if this is a dream
And when it hurts so right
Everything will be wonderful
I&apos;ll know it&apos;s real
And that life is beautiful
