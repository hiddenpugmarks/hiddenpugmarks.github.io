I think we all reach a point where all we want is a little more clarity.  I've been on a quest for such a thing recently on many levels.

How many levels exactly?  Let me see if I can quantify them all:
<ul>
<li>where I fit within my team at work</li>
<li>where I fit within my business unit at work</li>
<li>where I fit within my company</li>
<li>where I fit within my profession</li>
</ul>

This has all been an exercise to try and discover the relationship between my internally perceived value vs. the externally perceived value within each group.

There is a lack of clarity when it comes to issues like this.  In fact there is the exact opposite right now, an abundance of obfuscation.
