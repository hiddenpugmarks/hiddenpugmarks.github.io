My birthday, I have to say, was pretty awesome.  It was everything that I wanted it to be, which to some might sound boring; but to me was nearly perfect.  The only way it would have been better is if Holly hadn't been so sick.

As it stands, we traded horrible illnesses on eachother's birthdays this year.  I had a four day bout of stomach flu for her birthday, and I don't know for sure what she has right now but it is really terrible.  I fear for my life if I catch it, because she hardly ever gets sick.

The whole birthday experience has really been extended into more of a season this year.  It started in August while we were in New Brunswick to visit my family and go to a wedding.  And it will end on November 24th, when we go to see the Detroit Red Wings annihilate the Vancouver Canucks.  I'm thinking 5-2.

I really can't wait to go.  I have never had a chance to see the Red Wings play live.  Hank, Pavel, Nick, Ozzie; it's going to be a great time.  Even if I am the only one in the arena cheering for the Wings.

To top it all off, in all of 3D Realms' infinite wisdom, Duke Nukem 3D came out on Xbox Live Arcade on my birthday as well.  I downloaded it and jumped right in.  Within a couple of minutes I was laughing and flat out loving it.  I've missed Duke.  Any time you take lines from old Sam Raimi and John Carpenter movies, and throw them into a world being invaded by aliens... it's just magic.  Why Sam or John haven't made a Duke Nukem movie, I'll never know.

Tonight there will be some Duke Nukem happening for Friendly Fire Friday.  I always look forward to FFFs, but I'm <i>really</i> looking forward to this one.  I expect the universe will step in and cause the internet to implode so that it can't happen.

I think I'm going to start adding some tracks of the day to my posts.
