I&apos;m home and I&apos;m sick and it sucks!  I&apos;m really bad at being sick, especially a runny nose cold.  It&apos;s not the way it takes away my voice or the sore throat or the sore nose I hate.  It&apos;s the sense that some part of my body has betrayed me.  That no matter what I do short of taking cold medecine can make my nose stop running away.

Well that&apos;s a thoroughly disgusting intro I&apos;m sure.

I am playing World of Warcraft.  I do that a lot.  It helps me enjoy my time off from work and it helps keep me from thinking too much about my test I had to take last night.  I hate the waiting game.  

Hey, if there are any girls out there who want to go to a wedding at the end of July let me know. I don&apos;t want to go alone.  I absolutely dread the thought of going alone.  It feels so much like a failure in some way.

*cough* *cough* *sniffle*  damn cold!
