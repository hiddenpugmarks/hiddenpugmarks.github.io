Whatever they did with the latest World of Warcraft patch they need to undo!  It got seriously messed up with this patch.  The interface is nicer and more customizable but there are a crazy number of disconnects and timeouts happening.  I hope they have it all sorted out by tomorrow night.  I probably won&apos;t get to play all weekend so that will suck.

Easter is almost here.  Chocolate, fluffy bunnys and family.  Does it get any better?  Ahh, the world is crazy.

I feel optimisitic about getting the job I want.  That&apos;s usually a sign of impending doom though so don&apos;t tell anyone.  My friends there are already planning beer night :)

I sort of stumbled from an everyday conversation into an amazing conversation with a friend last night.  It was an amazing talk and well worth staying up until after 3:30am and being tired all day :)  At some point there the conversation felt like it was the bus in the movie Speed to me.  If it went any faster or slower it would have exploded.  It didn&apos;t though, so that&apos;s good!

Alas now I am exhausted.  Maybe I&apos;ll try and steal some of that sleep that I hear you get when you&apos;re dead tonight.  Four hours is enough to function and be coherent, but it&apos;s not quite enough to feel normal.

Some how though, I know I&apos;ll be up late again.  I&apos;m so bad at sleeping.
