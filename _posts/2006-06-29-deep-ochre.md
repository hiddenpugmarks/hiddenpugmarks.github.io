Last night was a great night.  Holly and I went out for the first time.

We started out with a safari through chapters (I got lost three times finding my way there...).  We met on the grassy plains of Young Adult fiction.  Brushed along the fences keeping the untamed Fantasy creatures from getting out.  Wandered through the misty rocks of Mystery.  Spent some time in the Cook Book petting zoo.

Since the safari seemed to be going well we opted to head out for dinner.  I had the fettucini alfredo, she had the crispy chicken salad; but really it was just an excuse to go sit somewhere and talk.  She tells wonderful stories.

After dinner we decided that we should go do something else.  A movie was out of the question, because I wanted to do something where we could keep talking.  So we went for a nice long drive.  She took me out to a place called Crescent Beach.  We walked along the beach for a while.  Walked and hopped along some drift wood logs.  Settled on a bench and talked watching the sun paint the sky a deep red as it sank into the horizon.

All I can say is that she is wonderful and amazing.  Now I have to wait all the way until Friday to see her again... or well, maybe tonight.
