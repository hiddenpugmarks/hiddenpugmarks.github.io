I followed the fallen blossom petals to work today.  I walked with them along the sidewalk as they danced and ran with the wind like a meandering stream of white and pink.  I watched them through the window of the bus as they swirled on currents of air.

I think that today is the coldest it has ever been since I moved to Vancouver.  A frigid nine degrees celsius...  I may never need to wear a jacket again.  Perhaps the trees were fooled into thinking that fall was on its way and shed their blossoms.

Life out here is good.  It's laid back.  It moves slow.  I can see myself here for a long time.  I still smile everytime I see the mountains.  Such ancient majesty.  Towering peaks wearing scarves of white snow.

It's funny.  I loved Montreal because it was so fast paced.  Everyone was in a hurry all of the time.  I enjoy Vancouver for the exact opposite reason.  I guess it just boils down to enjoying a life that isn't empty.  I wonder if my four years of living in nowhere will ever leave me?  Four years of waking up every morning and my first thought being "I don't want to go to work."

I have never worked anywhere else where they have asked me "Are you working at the capacity that is right for YOU? (i.e. putting in a balanced number of hours, appropriate to your workload, and in alignment with your task commitments, career interests and personal priorities)"

Happy first day of the fifth month everyone out there!
