Now that the Canadian Turkey Marathon Weekend (some call it Thanksgiving) is out of the way it is time for an Election.

Here in Canada we are about to elect our prime minister.  Will we have a repeat, or will someone else win?  I myself am not historically really much of a political person; and as long as the Liberals(Scary Mr. Dion) or Bloc Party(Snowball's chance in Hell) don't win I'll be happy.

Something that each election in Canada really drives home to me, is that our electoral process sucks.  Who we vote for Regionally, impacts who wins Nationally.  This just seems wrong, wrong, wrong to me.  The person that is going to be the best for my local region, and the person who would be the best leader for the country are completely unrelated (at least they should be).  National and Regional responsibilities and priorities are vastly different.

So in Canada you are forced to either vote for who you think will help your Region the most, or who is best for the country as a leader.  This year I've chosen to vote Nationally, and just vote based on the "Party Line" as it were.
