I&apos;ve suffered a lapse into creativity.  I&apos;m driven right now to do something.  To write something.  To just create something!  I&apos;ve been going through some of my old unfinished stories and thinking "How cool would it be if this was finished?"  I mean, it would just have to be damn cool.  Either because it turned out really well, or just because it was finished.

Tomorrow I make with the flying.  It&apos;s odd that after this week getting to sleep in until 7:00am before I have to get up, get ready and make my way to the airport feels like a bonus.

Today I made with the licensing.  It went smooth, like butter, like the surface of a fine water melon, like a touch of ice, like a nice beer.  It just went well.  So now I&apos;m licensed to drive again!

Next weekend I have a really, and I mean REALLY crazy plan!  I, am going, to f**king sleep!  I&apos;m not talking that light sleeping nappy bull. I&apos;m talking full on, the neighbours with drumkits, the world with bombs, couldn&apos;t wake me up sleeping.
