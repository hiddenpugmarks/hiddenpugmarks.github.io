Some of the things that I write have a strange way of coming true.  
That makes me a little wary of actually writing things down 
sometimes.  Something I wrote a few months is clawing it&apos;s way to 
truthfulness at an alarming pace.  It&apos;s one of those things I knew 
would happen, but it&apos;s not supposed to happen just yet, and... 
well... it has a way of complicating things that shouldn&apos;t be 
complicated.  

That&apos;s not entirely true.  Life is meant to be complicated I think.  
Especially mine.  It has always been a peg up in the realms of weird 
and hard over most people I know.

I got good news last night.  That was obviously followed up by bad 
news today.  That&apos;s just the cycle that&apos;s happening right now.  It&apos;s 
viscious and evil, but it&apos;s mine, and I&apos;m okay with it for now.
I decided to write something last night.  It&apos;s a special deviation 
from my normal writing style specifically for someone very important 
to me.  I&apos;m just afraid of how sad it will be :(

Whenever I write something amazing.  Something people can connect 
with.  Something that showcases my talents at their best, it is sad.  
I was once told that I write sad well.  It&apos;s true I guess.  I hope 
that someday I can write happy well.  I&apos;d rather bring smiles and 
tears of joy to people and connect with them on that level than I 
would make them feel sad.

That said, I am still looking forward to writing it.  I have part of 
it in my head already.  It has an obvious progression to it.

My old writing teacher always used to say that you have write about 
the things that you know and that you understand.  I&apos;ve had a lot of 
experience with sadness.  There have been a lot of wonderful and 
amazing things happen in my life.  Unfortunately there have been more 
negative things that have happened.  Guy that I am, I try to be 
positive about everything.  The world gets a little heavy for me once 
in a while though.

I&apos;m looking forward to my friend Amanda&apos;s wedding this summer.  My 
friend Valerie is getting married this summer too.  All around me 
people are getting married.  I hope to join that crowd someday.  I 
think I have a lot to offer someone.  I just need to find someone who 
can both see it and is interested in it.

There was a slight scheduling conflict with the wedding dates after 
moving and starting my new job, but I got that all sorted out.  
Quebec doesn&apos;t have an August long weekend, and yes, that is weird.  
It does have a June long weekend which would be the ideal time to 
head to New York.

I want to go. I don&apos;t want to go.  I want to go.  I don&apos;t want to go. 
 I just don&apos;t know what I&apos;ll do for all of the time that I&apos;d be alone 
in New York and wigged out of my skin.  I could probably find a 
theatre somewhere to catch up on movies or something.  I know there 
are a million things to do there.  Perhaps I&apos;ll ask some people I 
know who have been there before and see what they have to say.
I should wait for the "Special Project" do be done before I go.  At 
the same time I should go before the end of July.  It&apos;s a "Black Box" 
operation :)  There&apos;s probably only one other person out there who 
could possibly get that.

Argh!  Gasp!  It&apos;s soo hot in the office today.  Some days they just 
don&apos;t run the AC.  I don&apos;t know why yet.  It could sure be used today 
though.  It&apos;s so hot I can&apos;t think straight, and that makes me 
unproductive.  When I&apos;m unproductive I get bored.  When I get bored I 
don&apos;t work much.  I guess that&apos;s why I&apos;m writing this.

One more hour and I can go home.  I have some ice cream waiting for 
me in the fridge :)
