*kksshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh*  *snap* *crackle* *pop* (anyone else feel like cereal now?)

So, I stumbled across this today.  This is just very, very cool.  I had no idea that November was <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">National Novel Writing Month</a>!  Apparently the goal is to write 50,000 words in a month.

There are also some exceptionally cool calendars for it such as this random example I found on a random Live Journaler at <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/hellenelle/100775.html">http://www.livejournal.com/users/hellenelle/100775.html</a>.

I wont be participating this year as I unwittingly embarked on my own two week long Live Journal writing exodus.  Perhaps next year though.

We now return you to your regularly scheduled programming...
