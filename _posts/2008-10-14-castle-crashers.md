Why should you play Castle Crashers you ask?

An actual e-mail thread between my wife and I:

Holly: <i>My dude is now a level 12 castle crasher! Oh, Xboxy badness...</i>

Sean: <i>Haha, I'll have to level my guy up when I get home.  Did you get to the crazy "Ride a deer through a warehouse" level yet?</i>

Holly: <i>Yup! Took a couple rides to get through though. I also killed a giant mutant water cat while riding an aligator.</i>

If that doesn't pique your interest... nothing ever will.
