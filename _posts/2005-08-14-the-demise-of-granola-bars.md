Has anyone else noticed the demise of granola bars?  Does anyone else remember when granola bars were actually all granola and not 95% rice crispies?  I even remember when Dipps had chocolate all the way around them, and not just on the bottom.

The box of Chocolate Fudge Chewy Dipps I have right now even goes so far as to claim 30% less sugar.  Well duh!  There&apos;s like 90% less chocolate!  I don&apos;t know where the hell they put the rest of the sugar though.

And now, for a public service announcemnt....

"Untitled"
And she said
Don&apos;t live your life for me
And I said
But you mean everything to me
I swear that it all changed that night
Everything went from right to wrong
She&apos;d never been loved like that before
No one had ever written her a song
And before I knew it
The words were out there
I don&apos;t know if she really meant them
Or if it was just despair
