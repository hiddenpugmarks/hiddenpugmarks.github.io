It snowed.  I'm not talking a little bit either.  At Holly's we got 30cm of snow.  Some places further south it was up to 50cm.  The temperature also dipped down to -15Â°C.

Now, for me, that isn't really amazing in it's own right.  To a lot of you, it would just be an average snowfall.  However, this, was in British Columbia.  Yeah, that place that never snows.  I hear Washington state was hit quite hard as well.

30cm of snow means that the whole place shut down.  Almost no one has snow tires.  Almost no one who does knows how to drive in the snow.  They don't have enough plows to get to the small side streets.  Absolutely no one plows out a parking lot.  Over 90,000 people were without power this weekend.  It was a mad house.

Holly got told not to come in to work, and I called in to say that I wouldn't be making it in.  We weren't going to be going driving anywhere in that mess.

On Sunday night we had power at her place, and her parents didn't.  So she made dinner and we took it over to them.  On the way down to the parking garage we lost power in her building.  For some reason the garage door isn't hooked up to the emergency backup power.  So we had to manually open the garage door and head out.  By the time we got to her parents' place they had power back which was nice.

Anyway, we all survived the cold and the snow.  I guess I'll enjoy it while it lasts :)
