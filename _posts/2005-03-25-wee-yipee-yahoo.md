I am so very happy today!  I got the job that I had applied for and I can&apos;t wait to get moved and start.  There are just so many ups to this whole thing.

It will be cool to be reunited with some old college pals once again.  It will be cool to buy nice furniture in a place and at a time that I think I will care about it all.

I never could have made it this far without Ilona and my family urging me on.  Thanks so much everyone!  If I hadn&apos;t met Ilona I&apos;m sure I&apos;d still be just doing the daily grind.  Not that the daily grind was bad, but it was a rut.  This is something new, exciting and definitely progressive.  Plus, I&apos;m getting my second amazingly awesome raise in two years by doing this :)

Now I just have to make sure to get the book all looked after and not let her down.

I think this is going to be an amazing experience.  So many people are already planning trips to come visit me after I move.  Haha I can&apos;t wait :)

I don&apos;t get a lot of good things in my life, so I&apos;m really really enjoying this to the fullest!

I know there will be some sort of karmic whiplash somewhere along the way, but I&apos;ll deal with that when it happens.  For now, rock on!
