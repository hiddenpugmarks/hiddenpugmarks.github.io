I was thinking today about trying to get back into writing.  Other than my blog, I really haven't been writing in quite a long time.  In thinking about this I started wondering about the different categorizations of a piece of writing.  From what I can piece together, the following table is how it works:

|Category|Word Count|
|-|-|
|Short Shorts/Short Short Fiction|1-1,000|
|Short Story|1,000-7,500|
|Novelette|7,500-17,500|
|Novella|17,500-40,000|
|Novel|40,000+|

I would like to write something that falls into each of these categories.  I know it won't happen right away, but I think it's a good goal to try and have completed by something like 2010.
