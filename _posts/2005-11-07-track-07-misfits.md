"My people are the misfits
The ones that don&apos;t fit in
With the smile I know it comes within
I can feel you in the corners laughing when the lightings low"
...
"Those are the ones for me
Those are the ones for me
The misfits, the freaks, the enemy, you and me"


Ever been a misfit?  Felt like a misfit?  Thought someone else was a misfit?

I&apos;ve always been a misfit.  I&apos;ve never really found a place or a group where I was like everyone else.  I&apos;ve seen circles of people that you can look at and tell that they are obviously friends, because they are all the same.

I have always been me.  Nothing else.  Nothing less.  How would I be anyone else?

From the way I dress to the foods I eat to the way I work to the things I find fun to, well, everything, I am an individual.

When I was in high school there was a very obvious division of the student body.  One half were the "Preps", the other half the "Grubs".  I straddled the line.  One day I would hang out with one group and the next day I would hang out with the other.  I just floated in limbo.  I couldn&apos;t understand the source of the division.  I still can&apos;t see what was so different among those groups.  I guess that&apos;s because I didn&apos;t really fit in to either group.

I have certainly found great circles of friends.  Great individuals.  We get along and we have fun and we are what friends are supposed to be.  We don&apos;t necessarily like all of the same things, but we all like enough of the same things.  We are all quite independent.  We are all quite dependant on each other.

I count myself lucky to be among my group of misfits.  People who have gravitated toward each other over class, gender, religious, and even national boundaries.  I think, like I&apos;m sure everyone else does, that my friends are the greatest.

In a way, we are all misfits in the end.  We find the people who are freaks from the consumer advertised definition of normal in the same ways that we are.  In those people we find family and solace.  Comfort and strength.  Support and laughter.  Even inspiration.

And when we find that perfect freak we fall in love :)

Tune in tomorrow for "Can&apos;t Get Away".
