So that's that.  I formally resigned today.  Time to move on to the next step in this adventure we call life.  I have always compared my life to a roller coaster because of all of the crazy ups and downs it has.  So I've had a 10 month break as I climbed up to the crest of the next hill and now it's time to go hurtling down the other side.

I promised myself no regrets no matter how this move turns out.
