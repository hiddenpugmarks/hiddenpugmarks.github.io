So, it&apos;s 4:42am.  I just got home from the Ubisoft Christmas party.  I&apos;m thankful that the doorman was on a break when I got home.  I wouldn&apos;t want to have tripped all over the place infront of him. It would have been bad.

However.  On the plus side. The cabbie who got me home got the tip of his life.  I gave him a 27 dollar tip for getting me home safe.  I&apos;m so hammered right now it isn&apos;t even funny.  I drank so much vodka, and then when the bar ran out I drank so much beer.  I can&apos;t even put numbers to it.

All I can really remember is seeing a bunch of my friends and their girlfriends, and talking to some people from work.  Just like every other party, I partied until I got thrown out.


There were five floors of dancing, sugar, food, naked dancing women, food and free alcohol.  Needless to say I had a good time.  Sure, the music sucked, but the friends were great.

I was even so drunk that I danced with reckless abandon for a few minutes on the dance floor.  Then I sauntered, or more likely stagered almost passing out, my way over to this wonderful short haired blonde girl and told her that I thought she was the most beautiful girl at Ubisoft.  I meant it then, I mean it now, and I always will.  I finally found out Melanies&apos;s name, and she promised that she would remember mine.  I don&apos;t think she will, but nonetheless, it was a good time.

As usual, I outlasted the crowd.  I was among the last to leave.  Trying to talk my way through the bouncers to the bar for one last drink.  I vaguely remember giving some black guy 10 dollars not to beat up a friend of mine because he hit on  the black guy&apos;s sister.  I also vaguely remember getting home.  Stopping at the bank and using the wheel chair access button to get in because I couldn&apos;t figure out where I was supposed to swipe my card.

Here I am now.  Home.  Safe.  That&apos;s why the cabbie got the insane tip.  He even stopped and said "Wait, you gave me..." when I interrupted and said "Yes.  $40.  You deserve it.  Thanks for getting me home safe."  for a 13$ fare.

Will anyone remember anything monday morning?  God, I don&apos;t know.  I will always remember Melanie dancing, and the rest of the fun I had.

What a good time!

Rock on!  Party on!  It&apos;s time for me to collapse into a different world.  Nighty night world and everyone it!!!

As I say good night, wondering why I&apos;m drinking chocolate milk and when I&apos;ll throw it up, as well as contemplating how much I care about Meghan; I wish you all good night.
