So the cat is out of the bag and all is signed and done.  I will be starting a new job in just over two weeks.

It is pretty crazy to be switching jobs normally, but doing it right before Christmas makes it feel a little crazier.

It should mean less overtime.  For those who don't know, that means I might actually get some weekends during the summer.  That is a pretty fantastic concept at the moment.  I haven't had a guaranteed free weekend during the summer in a very long time.

All in all, it was still a very tough decision.  I will miss being surrounded by hockey every day.  The people I am going to be working with are some of the best and brightest that I have ever met though.  For someone like me who loves to learn and explore, it is a perfect move.

One of the things I've heard from where I'm going is that they like to hire people who aren't afraid to speak up and argue with really smart people, which means that they generally end up hiring other really smart people.

I am really excited about my new job!
