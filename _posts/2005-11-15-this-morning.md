I woke up this morning for the 25th time as my alarm went off for the 25th time.  I slowly extracted myself from the tangle of sheets and blankets. I stretched and yawned and did complex math in my head to determine if I could have just five more minutes of sleep.

The answer this time, unlike the previous 24 times, was no.

Rubbing the sleep from my eyes I wandered toward my window in a tired haze.  When I pulled the curtains aside I was greeted by a wondrous site that filled me with joy.  There before me was the sky painting the city in a lovely white.  Angel dust feathers of snow fluttering to the ground.

Snowflakes kiss the ground
Softer than my lips touch yours
The city is born again
From dark to light, rebirth
