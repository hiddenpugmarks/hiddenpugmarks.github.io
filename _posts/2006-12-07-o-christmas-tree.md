So we put up the Christmas tree at Holly's last weekend.  We bought some of those new LED lights, a few ornaments and some silver bids.  We're pretty happy with the tree :)

It was nice to have a start to the Christmas Season like this.  Holly baked cookies and made home made cocoa and we trimmed the tree.  It was an all around good time.

Her cat Max didn't quite know what to make of the tree.  When we hauled it out of the box he got so stressed out that he threw up (he's a nervous creature).  Now it seems like he feels right at home with it though.  There is some evidence of him trying to climbe it and he enjoys sleeping under it.

Tree after you've had too much to drink:
