I just have to start everything off by saying that Sin City is awesome!

I&apos;ve been making a lot of mistakes lately I think.  Breaking promises that I made to myself and things like that.  I&apos;ll have to fix that all up I guess.  I&apos;m going to have a very long and quiet think sometime in the next couple of days.  Sort some things out in my mind.  Sort some things out in my life.  Stop freaking out some of my good friends like I think I have been.

I only have two days of work left.  The work days get longer with every passing minute.  I would swear that every single minute takes twice as long as the last one while I&apos;m there.  I&apos;m looking forward to the parties before I go.  Should be some good times :)

Then I&apos;ll be looking forward to when everyone moves to work where I&apos;m headed, or at the very least comes to visit.  

When my project that I&apos;m working on with a good friend of mine that I&apos;ve never met finishes up I think I&apos;ll disappear for a while.  Maybe take the WWF up on one of those working vacations or something.  Maybe just withdraw and play a week of Halo.  Could be anything.

Have you ever have something happen that is probably a coincidence, but you have no way to be sure?  And it leaves you wondering why something happened or what you did wrong?  I hate times like that.  What if it wasn&apos;t a coincidence?  I had a moment like that tonight.  I just can&apos;t shake it.

I&apos;m sure I could say a lot more tonight, but I&apos;m really tired.

Rest will this night.
