= A short interlude = 

If you haven't seen Hot Fuzz yet, then you must go now!  Now!  Now I said!

It is quite possibly the funniest movie that I have ever seen.  People in the theater were clapping, yelling, hollering and I even believe there may have been some hooting.  Don't read reviews or previews of it.  Don't watch trailers.  Just go see it!  Now!

For the gamers out there if you haven't tried the PC demo of <a href="http://www.infinite-interactive.com/puzzlequest/demo.php">Puzzle Quest</a>, or one of the other various flavours of Puzzle Quest, this is also something else that you must go do now.  It has possessed everyone at work.
