Tonight I went to the Montreal stop in the Bluebird North 2006 tour at Main Hall.   It was wonderful.  Several schools of music were represented and each of the performers had great stories to tell between songs.

Let me first introduce the players of the evening:

Dave Gunning is a modern day minstrel spinning amazing stories with his music (<a href="http://www.davegunning.com/">website</a>).
Emm Gryner the insanely amazing unknown Canadian pop goddess (<a href="http://www.peterelkas.com/">website</a>).
Peter Elkas the only soulrock artist I know of (<a href="http://www.peterelkas.com/">website</a>).
Kardinal Offishall of Canadian hip-hop fame (<a href="http://www.kardinaloffishall.com/">website</a>).
Andy Stochansky the anti-hipster (<a href="http://www.andystochansky.com/">website</a>).
Jonathan Cummins from the Montreal punk band Bionic (<a href="http://www.bionicland.com/">website</a>).

Oddly enough, even with all of these people showing up the venue wasn't packed.  It isn't even really a large venue.  It is by far the most obscure venue I've ever had to track down.  The first time I looked for it I walked past it twice.  It is literally just a door in the side of building with a number on it.  No signs.  No labels.  Nothing.

Once you do manage to find the door you walk up a flight of narrow steep stairs, which isn't a problem on the way up while sober.  On the way down, they can be a different story.  Inside there isn't anything special.  A few chairs.  A stage.  A bar.  Sometimes a coat check.  However, it is still a pretty good venue because it has a great sound system.

The night started off slow and quiet.  The host Shari Ulrich opened up with a song.  Then the rotation went roughly Stochansky, Elkas, Cummins, Gryner, Gunning, Offishall and repeat all night.  The host would play a song each round as well.

It was amazing how Stochansky would play a slow, but loud and intense song to kick off each round.  Then Elkas would slow everything down with his twangy soul rock.  Cummins would play random trucking and drinking songs.  Since this was pretty much an accoustic event and he's a punk rocker he wasn't playing any of his own music.  It was great when he got the crowd shouting "Weed!  Whites!  And Wine!"  Then Gryner would simply stun the crowd with her voice and intensity.  Gunning would carry the crowd away with a wonderful musical story.  Then last, but certainly not least, Offishall would finish each round.  As he was up there rapping he would get the whole crowd into it.  Yelling out and singing along.  Standing and grooving to one of his tracks even.

For me the highlights of the night were:
- Emm Gryner.  Always and forever.
- The banter between the singers
- Offishall calling his DJ "Instrument"
- Stochansky losing himself in every song
- Gunning's great stories.  The songs, and the stories between songs.

In going out to see the tour I did miss Molten Core.  Apparently my character got to tank Ragnaros.  However I don't regret anything.  Nothing is more magical and wondrous than Emm with a keyboard/piano.  I could listen to her forever.  Just ask my friends :p
