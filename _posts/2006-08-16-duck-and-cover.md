So this whole staying under the radar thing really isn't working very well for me it seems.  It looks like I'm probably going to get loaned out to another team to help them along while we are in preproduction on the next NHL title.

I had my every other week review meeting with my manager today and it went sort of like this:

(Paraphrased of course)
Manager: How was your day off?
Me: It was great.   It's always nice to sleep in and relax.
Manager: So how would you feel about going to help out *game name*?  *Name of head of all software engineers* was wondering if you would be able to help them out.
Me: Uhhh... I guess it could be interesting...  as long as they aren't finaling.  I don't want to go from finaling one game to finaling another.
Manager: Good, I'll let them know you can help out then.
Me: ...

So now I'm slowly starting to rethink things in sort of a "If you can't beat them, join them"-esque manner.

NHL is almost out of the woods.  It's just wandering through the thick razor grass at the moment on the edge of the forest.  Hopefully soon it will all be done and gone and we can start next year's version.  As it stands the office is sort of a ghost town anyway.  Lots of people are on 2,3, and more week vacations (lucky bastards).

Holly and I both have our time off booked for a trip home for Thanksgiving.  Fly out on Friday, October 6th.  Fly back on Tuesday, October 10th.  Recuperate on Wednesday, October 11th.  I might even tack on a couple of my vacation days and take the rest of that week off.

This Sunday is dinner with her family... that should prove interesting.  Hopefully I can come up with something to talk about.  I've never been that good at talking to strangers when there is a huge age gap, and an assumption that we really don't have much in common other than their wonderful daughter.

I raided last night for the first time in a couple of months.  On the one hand, it was nice to be back and raiding again.  On the other hand, not being the main tank makes for very boring warrioring.  I guess I just sort of expected the MT position to be handed back when I returned.  It was good to see a lot of the crew again though.

I can't wait until the expansion and the new dungeons that are built around only needing 25 people instead of 40!
