Just two more sleeps and Holly will be back!  Hopefully then I'll start sleeping again.  It has been so strange not having her around that I'm not even sure I could truly capture it with words.

I just don't go to bed any more.  It is like I don't know when bed time is or something.  I also can't seem to get out of bed in the morning.  I can only equate it to something as monumentally odd as waking up one day and the sun being gone, but the rest of the world hasn't noticed.

I find myself completely losing track of time.  I wake up what feels like a hundred times a night and toss and turn.  The cats are acting strangely.  They'll sit looking at the door, or sometimes wander from room to room meowing; looking for Holly.

While she's away I no longer have something to look forward to every day.  I normally always look forward to going home and seeing her.  Just that is enough to make every day better, worthwhile.  It seems like now I just go home and sit there listlessly while I play video games or slip into a vegetative state while the images on the TV screen flicker by.  Before I know it it's 2am and nothing has happened.

I miss my Holly.
