It&apos;s been good, and it&apos;s been smooth, and it&apos;s been great, and I&apos;ve made mistakes.  Well that&apos;s life :)

I&apos;ve found that it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour to get to or from work depending on certain circumstances.  Like today when I was way ahead of schedule but the train was running so I couldn&apos;t cut across the tracks.  That meant quite the long detour.

I&apos;ve been sleeping too much and that&apos;s leaving me exhausted it seems.

This weekend I&apos;m going to go checkout Hitchhiker&apos;s Guide to the Galaxy and Kingdom of Heaven.  I expect both to be excellent!

I am still looking for an apartment.  I have one more to look at this Saturday and then I&apos;m going to make my decision and move.  I miss all of my stuff that&apos;s tucked away in storage.  And yeah, ALL of my stuff is tucked away in storage.  I&apos;m going through WoW withdrawal.

Plus, I think that I&apos;ll enjoy this place even more when I have permanent access to the internet again because I&apos;ll be able to spend a few hour surfing concert listings and checking out the smaller independant theatres etc, etc.

I&apos;ve even been writing some which is cool.

I hope all is well out there :)
