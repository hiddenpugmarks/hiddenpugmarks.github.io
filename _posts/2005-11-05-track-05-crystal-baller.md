"I want to be your Crystal Baller"

Have you ever seen your future with someone?  Have you seen it the thousands of ways that it could play out?  The good ways and the bad ones?

The song is about the want to be there for someone forever.  I know that feeling well.  I always want to be there for all of my friends.  I hope they will all always be there for me.

A lot of people look at themselves and see a freak.  We are generally the harshest judges of ourselves.  Every once in a while you find a person who doesn&apos;t see a freak when they look at you.  They see something else.  They see something that you wish you could be.  Maybe someone who could be loved.

Sometimes though, the more that person can&apos;t accept your negative aspects, or the more you can&apos;t let it go that maybe those aspects don&apos;t exist, it makes you weaker.  The weaker you get the pettier you get.  Until the end comes and you ruin something that was amazing and could have been more so.

It would be wonderful if we could all have crystal balls and see the future.  It would be wonderful to know how it will all work out in the end.  Who will you be with.  How will you get there.  At least, it sounds like it would be wonderful.

Really though, how wonderful would it be to get to a destination without the journey along the way?  You would never get to experience things the same way if you knew they were going to happen.  They wouldn&apos;t have the same impact on your or your life.  You might even take things for granted.  You would just look at your crystal ball and think, well, this is how it is supposed to be.  You shouldn&apos;t have to do anything for it then.

Let&apos;s all just enjoy the journey.  Don&apos;t worry too much about the future.  Just live life and see where it goes.  It might just surprise you.

Tune in tomorrow for "My Hit and Run".
