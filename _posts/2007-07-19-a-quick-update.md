It has been a long time since I put words in this place.

I guess it has partially been because I have been too busy with work and partially because I just didn't seem to have anything to say.

Work has been... intense.  That's a sugar coated way to say crazy.  Last weekend was the first weekend I've had in as long as I can remember.  One good point of my first game job was that, while we might have worked absolutely insane numbers of hours during the week; we always took the weekend off.  People need that time to keep from burning out.

As I haven't had that time, I have been burning out.  I'm blackened and crispy.

But, enough about work.  It depresses me.

This Friday, I guess that's tomorrow, Holly is going away on a trip with her Girl Guide Troop.  She'll be gone for 7.5 days, which is 7.4999999 days too long.  We haven't been apart for that long since Christmas.  I am already missing her and she's still here.

I honestly can't remember what life is like without her.  I don't want to.  She's so wonderful.  I love her so much.  She makes me smile every single day.
