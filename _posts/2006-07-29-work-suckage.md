Sometimes, work really sucks.  I wish I knew how I ended up back in a position of responsibility at work again.  Even though I was trying so hard not to fall into an importan role, here I am again.

With responsibility comes suckage.  Apparently I'm a "lead of my area", but I'm not a lead.  Apparently my role is too crucial to be able to take some time off and go on a trip with Holly, but 95% of the rest of the team can get time off.  I don't want the responsibility.  I want to spend time with the woman I love.

In my next review I'm going to ask about how come I don't have the title of a lead, or the pay of a lead, but I have the responsibility of being a lead.

Last night while Holly and I were out at dinner celebrating our anniversary, work called... twice...  Needless to say, I wasn't too pleased about that.  Even our waitress seemed upset about it.

With that behind us we finised our wonderful Greek dinner and headed out to the movies to see Lady in the Water.  An excellent movie on all accounts.  A little humour, a little terror, a great story.  It's a story about someone named Story.

And now, I'm at work.  As far as I can tell it's because QA tends to be useless.  They must have bad test plans.  It's our third demo submission to them and they are just starting to test certain things.  Everything should be tested on every submission I would think.  It seems like common sense to me.

Hopefully all of this unpleasantness inside will fade away before I head home.
