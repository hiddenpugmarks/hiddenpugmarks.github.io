The commute has returned to normal, but so far I haven't.  I have still being trying to stick with the routine of leaving the house before 7am so that I can get to work by 7:30am.  Getting to work that early means that I can leave at 4pm (which hasn't actually happened yet).

I find that when I get in early and I have 2-3 hours to work without interruptions that I get a lot more done.  Plus, even though I'm there for the same amount of time, or sometimes more; it all flies by pretty quickly.  The morning has this way of just zipping by, while afternoons tend to drag on.

Holly & I have both started playing Fable II.  I have to say, it is a great game.  It is vastly improved version of the original.  They seem to have gotten everything "right" this time around.  I actually enjoy some of the mini games so much that it has slowed my progression through the game; and I can only see that as a good thing.

Somehow the game seems to magically cater to all types of gamers.  You can earn experience the old fashioned way, by killing t hings; or you can buy it in the form of potions to power up.  You just need to make some money, be it through a real estate empire, doing odd jobs or gambling.

I look forward to trying out the multiplayer again sometime.  Last time I didn't really enjoy it, but I was still figuring out how the game worked.  I think this time around we could take on some bounty hunter work and really do some damage.

Now, on to a sweet, sweet tangent.  I've been making the family style Haystacks quite often for the last little while; and I've really been enjoying them and the process.  I had honestly forgotten just how tastey something so simple could be.  They are quick and simple to make, and it is really nice to know what exactly is in the food your eating.

I tried to make a lower calorie version of them using Splenda, and wow, did that ever backfire.  I wish I had pictures, but those who have made them know that they are a time sensitive monstrosity to wrk with.  The splenda just sort of evaporated, apparently the bulk of Splenda is just a chemical filler.  Instead of the mixture bubbling up to fill the pot half full, it instead made the pot about 1/15th full.

We are still working away at that failed batch.  They're not goood per se, bet they aren't awful either.  They are sort of what I imagine an unsweetened Eat-More chocolate bar would taste like.

Other than that not a lot has been going on.  Lots of work.  I'm working mornings and afternoons, and Holly is working afternoons and evenings; so we haven't seen a lot of eachother lately.

We have been browsing the MLS listings for Eastern Canada.  Seeing what is out there and thinking about the future.  We have found a few places that we absolutely love.  The job prospects aren't so great for us out that way though.  There are maybe four companies out there in my industry.  One of the places we found that we liked would be absolutely ideal if I could work from home.

I really don't know why in this age of computers more people can't work from home.
