Yesterday I walked home from work with a couple of a friends.  One of these friends is a lot like me.  He&apos;s been living here in Montreal for a while and he&apos;s had some bad and some strange encounters with people.  Both of us sort of expect that in city life.  The other friend has lived in Montreal for about five years and he hasn&apos;t really had any strange encounters.

We we&apos;re walking through this spot, between the construction site and the train tracks, and there was a guy to the left of us.  He was going through the garbage that the near by apartment buildings had put out for the week.  He was tossing frying pans, circulating fans, bicycles, and other miscellaneous junk on to the back of his rust coloured truck.  Well, it wasn&apos;t actually rust coloured I guess, since it was really just actual rust.

He gave as a bit of a once over as we walked by, but we just stepped a little further away and kept going.

About 15 minutes later the three of us were on the subway.  I looked at them both and I said "Well, that was my weird encounter for the day.  I&apos;m glad to have that over with."  The first friend, he nods in agreement.  The second friend said "What guy?"

My first friend and I just looked at each other in disbelief.  "The guy!  With the pots and pans and fans and rusty old truck.  You know, where all of the clanging was coming from."

Second friend "I didn&apos;t see that.  Where was that?"

The first friend and I just stood there in stunned silence.  We understand now why our other friend hasn&apos;t ever had any strange encounters or witnessed anything odd.  It&apos;s because he is completely unaware of his surroundings.

Even today.  I still can&apos;t believe how he didn&apos;t see that guy, or hear him, or anything.

In other news---

This weekend is Canadian Thanksgiving weekend.  I point this out, because I don&apos;t think anyone who actually reads this blog happens to be Canadian.  I&apos;m looking forward to it.  Tomorrow I&apos;m heading up to a friends place for the weekend to hang out and catch up and eat KFC for thanksgiving.

It&apos;s a little odd.  This is the first thanksgiving that I haven&apos;t spent with my family.  I wonder when the first Christmas will be?  I hope never.  There are just certain things, at least in my family, that hold basically no value if family and friends aren&apos;t around for it.

Happy Canadian Thanksgiving everyone!  I hope all of you find or have something bright and wonderful happen to you this weekend
