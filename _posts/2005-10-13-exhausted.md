I&apos;m exhausted.  So very exhausted.  So very tired.  I took two days off of work this week because I couldn&apos;t wake up or get going.

I had a cough and a stuffy nose so I thought it must just be a strange cold or flu.  I don&apos;t know though.  It&apos;s day three and I&apos;m still exhausted.  I&apos;ve been eating right, drinking right, taking it easy; basically doing everything I can think of.  Still, I&apos;ve been sleeping 75% of my day away for the last couple of days.

Everything feels normal other than being tired.

My building had no hot water today.  So I started the day off with an invigoratingly cold shower.  Then I proceeded to drink two cans of coke, just for the caffeine.  It&apos;s not working.  And I hardly ever drink caffeine.  I kicked that habit ages ago.

So what&apos;s wrong?  I wish I knew.  Someone suggested loneliness or depression.  I guess that could be.  I&apos;ve been lonely for a long time though, so it&apos;s odd it would just start affecting me out of the blue.  I&apos;m probably just messed up in the head.

I&apos;ll give it another week and see how things are.  Hopefully the yawning will stop by then.

I will continue researching sources of fatigue and see if something clicks.

Have a nice *yawn* day everyone.
