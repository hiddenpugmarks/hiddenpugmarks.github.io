There is an epidemic passing through our office.  It has been nicknamed The Grey Plague.  One by one, almost the entire programming team has been hit by it and taken out.  It seems to be really bad for a couple of days, then okay for one or two, and then really bad again for a couple of days.

I've been out sick two days this week and I feel bad about it.  I feel physically horrible, but I still feel like I should have been in at work on those days.

When I got in today and found out just how many people had been out for 2+ days I didn't feel quite as bad.  I'm doing my best not to cough or breathe on people.
