I was thinking today about trying to get back into writing.  Other than my blog, I really haven't been writing in quite a long time.  In thinking about this I started wondering about the different categorizations of a piece of writing.  From what I can piece together, the following table is how it works:

<center>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0>
 <tr>
  <td align><b>Category</b></td><td align=center><b>Word Count</b></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td align>Short Shorts/Short Short Fiction</td><td align=center>1-1,000</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td align>Short Story</td><td align=center>1,000-7,500</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td align>Novelette</td><td align=center>7,500-17,500</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td align>Novella</td><td align=center>17,500-40,000</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td align>Novel</td><td align=center>40,000+</td>
 </tr>
</table>
</center>

I would like to write something that falls into each of these categories.  I know it won't happen right away, but I think it's a good goal to try and have completed by something like 2010.
