Ilona had one of these up in her blog, and it seemed interesting to me.  So, I'd like you all to fill it out for me as well :)  (That means you too Meghan)

Brief description from the website:

<i>The Johari Window was invented by Joseph Luft and Harrington Ingram in the 1950s as a model for mapping personality awareness. By describing yourself from a fixed list of adjectives, then asking your friends and colleagues to describe you from the same list, a grid of overlap and difference can be built up.</i>
