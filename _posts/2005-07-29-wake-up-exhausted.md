So, think slow, be cool, drive fast.  Yeah, it&apos;s all nonsense.  Just spewed out there for the masses.  It&apos;s like a tag line or a log line.  Just there to try and pull you in.  To sell you on what the product is that your about to digest with your mind and your self.

The world is fugged.  At least the little microcosm I exist in.  One of the best and nicest programmers at work said he was leaving today.  Which sucks, because out of all of the programmers he&apos;s the one I&apos;ve become the best friends with.  It&apos;s good for him overall.  I wish him the best, but damn.

Move to a new place.  Make new friends.  They move away.  That stuff only happens in my world.  Or at least it feels like it.

So I&apos;m going to a wedding this weekend.  My friend Amanda is taking that next wonderful step in her life.  Somehow I always thought I&apos;d get there first, but I wish her all the happiness in the world and only the best things in life.  I hope she likes her present when she sees it :)

I bought some "real" clothes today for the wedding event.  Tomorrow I might pick up some new shoe type items as well.  I have to tell you, wearing a real shirt and real pants, it just makes me feel like a freak.  Maybe once a month I don&apos;t wear a hockey jersey with jeans or shorts depending on the season.  Silly yes, but oh so comfortable.

It&apos;ll be my second four day weekend in a row.  My second flight tour out to the east coast and back to Montreal.  It&apos;s getting re-god-damn-diculous, this whole flying thing.  The planes keep getting smaller and smaller!  Mind you, the passengers keep getting cuter and friendlier :)

By the time I get back it will be the 13th plane I&apos;ve been on this year.  I know that&apos;s not a lot for some people, but for me who just last year hadn&apos;t been on a plane since I was three, this is just getting out of hand.  It&apos;s not that I don&apos;t like flying, it&apos;s that I don&apos;t like airports and more importantly, airport security.

I need more Emm Gryner and Tegan &amp; Sara.  Well, at least Sara *drool* she&apos;s so cute!  Mostly I just want to see them live again.  All of them, any of them.  Emm is doing a living room tour this year, I wish I was in the area she was doing it in.  I&apos;d make room in my living room for sure!

Tomorrow I do the Driver&apos;s License Dance Part I.  Hopefully there will only need to be one part, but let&apos;s face it, there will be many parts.  It will become a trial of righteousness and patience.  That&apos;s what these things do.

This entry needs some more randomness.  So here&apos;s a sliver of the ever blossoming poetry tree that grows inside my head:

Out of my fingers
And into my cup
The world falls down
Because I&apos;m full up

I know so many wonderful people.  I hope some of them think I&apos;m wonderful too.

Good night World!
