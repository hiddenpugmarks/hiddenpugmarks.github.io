Well, it turns out that there won't be any grand adventure in San Francisco.  I'm still not completely sure how I feel about it.  A little bit sad.  A little bit relieved.

I guess now it is time to focus a little more here locally in the here and now and figure out what will be happening after this project.

There are certainly things that I would like to do on my current project next year.  I'm not sure if they will let me, but I need to do them for my own sanity.

At the same time, a new project could also be interesting.
