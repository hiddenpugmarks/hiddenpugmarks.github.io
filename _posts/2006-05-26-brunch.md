dark and secret
all things perfect
wandering around
in the tall concrete
sneaking beneath canopies
as the rain pelts down
soaking and drowning
smiling wetly
dodging street people
with organizers
who knew the homeless
required schedules
past the japanese tourists
taking pictures of everything
of the 24 hour McDonalds
so much taken for granted
across a busy street
through a crowd of people
up the steps of an unsigned building
arrival at Saturday brunch
