It's been a long time since I posted here.  It isn't a lack of things going on, so much as them not being complete enough to really write about mixed with a lack of time to put them down.

Work is busy right now.  Not insanely busy, not like it gets around a milestone, but busy enough.  I'm slipping a little on one of my tasks.  Mostly because the last 2+ years of history has shown that it should take less than a week to do this task, but this time around it is starting to slip over the edge of 2+ weeks.  It has been a road plagued by crocodiles and pitfalls.  Hopefully it will be done soon.  Every time it starts to look up, something new breaks, and it starts all over again.

Holly and I have been living out of the our bedroom lately.  The living room floor is all torn out now, down to just the concrete subfloor.  All of the living room furniture is crammed into the spare room and our room.  I've discovered that the bed isn't nearly as comfortable for watching TV as the couch is; which is very contrary to my initial thoughts on the issue.

The playoffs have come and gone.  My Detroit Red Wings have once again been crowned Stanley Cup Champions!  It was a great playoff run.  Zetterberg and Datsyuk put on a clinic game in and game out of how hockey should be played.  I don't think I'll ever forget that shift where the Wings were down two men and Zetterberg killed nearly a minute and a half of the penalty on his own.  I'm concerned that the Red Wings won't be able to afford all of their players for too much longer.

I've been mulling over the idea of taking another writing course.  It just don't see how I can fit it into my life.  They always say that if it's important enough you'll make time for it, so I guess we'll see what happens.

The diet has sort of stalled.  I guess that's normal.  I'm down to losing in the vicinity of 1-2 lbs a month.  The pizza hungry center of my brain constantly tells me I could do better by exercising rather than dieting, but that requires <i>even more</i> time out of the day.

In the famous poem "The Night Before Christmas" when it talks about visions of sugar plums dancing in their heads... I know what that's like.  Only I don't have to be asleep to see the tempting dancing forms of pizza slices, sandwiches, toast, pasta, etc.  Only about 190 days left to go.

That isn't to say that I haven't been eating wonderful food.  Just last night we had a flank steak rolled around chorizo and caramelized onions, pan seared and then roasted until finished perfectly.  I miss having a slice of bread or a roll with something like that though.  I've even been known to consider potatoes to look sort of yummy these days.

This morning our flooring finally arrived.  Just a few more days and we will once again have a living room floor.  We can even put a couch or two back out there.  I look forward to "moving back in" to our place.

Today I also finally RSVP'd to the wedding of my friends Alex and Julie.  It has been a long time coming and I look forward to it.  Next comes booking the flights which will happen today or tomorrow.  It looks like we're going to attempt the red-eye again... I'm not looking forward to it, but I'll take some Gravol this time around in the hopes that it will put me to sleep.

All in all, life is great :)
