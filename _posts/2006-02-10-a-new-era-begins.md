I have finally crawled out of my <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">LiveJournal</a> shell into the great wide world.

It's interesting to think that I started this blog, just to read someone else's.  Now it has grown into a full fledged public diary of sorts.

I am going to keep my old blog entries where they are.  I had thought about moving them over, one at a time, but it just seemed wrong on some level.  Those thoughts, those times, they took place over there.  Old entries can be found at <a href="http://hiddenpugmarks.livejournal.com/">hiddenpugmarks.livejournal.com</a>

Welcome to the new world.
