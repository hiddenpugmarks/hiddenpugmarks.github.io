Today is a better place than yesterday was.  Saturday will undoubtedly be a worse place.  So for now, I think I&apos;ll just live in the moment and in the day.  Really, what more can you do?

I could plan the rest of my life out.  I could plan how wonderful it would be and everything I would accomplish with it.  You know what would happen then?  I&apos;d get hit by a bus somewhere along the way and I would have missed out on all of those moments in the here and the now.  A single wonderful moment today is worth more than a dozen planned ones that never happen.

Speaking of wonderful moments, epiphanies are great.  I had one last night.  It&apos;s so amazing to be sitting around thinking to yourself "What the hell is wrong?  What is going on?  Why?" and then have that forehead slapping moment of clarity when it all comes together.
