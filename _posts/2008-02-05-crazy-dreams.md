I have been known to have some crazy dreams.  Dreams that are vivid, abstract, chaotic, senseless and all together captivating.

<hr />

Snow flakes could be seen descending from the dark gray sky on the other side of the fogged window.  Aven spread her fingers out and pushed her palm against the silky window's surface.  She lifted her hand and looked through the hand print left behind into the world outside.

"It's been eleven years..." Aven turned to the source of the voice behind her.  "Why now?  What's changed?"

Aven looked at the face before her.  She studied its features closely.  The last time she had seen this face it was only seventeen years old.  She could see that the years since then had been hard.  Deep inside of his eyes she could still see the same strength, determination and... hope.  It had been so long since she had seen hope that Aven had nearly forgotten what it looked like.

"Everything" she whispered.

"Everything what?" Vilente shot back.  He wasn't in the mood for games.  He couldn't even believe he was here.  Eleven years away from her and he came right back after hearing a single word.  It was a word that he had never heard her say.  <i>Help.</i>

"Everything" she said again, her voice stronger.

Vilente looked her over.  Aven's eyes were dark and cold.  He could tell there was something just beneath the surface that she was holding back.  "How can <i>everything</i> change?" he asked her.

She pulled up her left sleeve revealing a symbol.  "I know you're a part of the Revins" a hint of anger seeped into his voice as he remembered their parting.  She had joined one of <i>The Houses</i> and it had ended their life together.  He was destined to be an Observer, and Observers could never be part of a House.

Aven just nodded at him.  She heard the anger in his voice and a nearly hidden undertone of sadness.  She turned around and wrapped her fingers around the neck of her shirt.  She pulled it down stretching it deliberately to reveal a second symbol.

She heard a quick intake of breath and turned around to see a look of shock on Vilente's face.  She looked him in the eyes again and said "I'm one of the 13th.  <i>That</i> changes everything."

Vilente reached out and wrapped Aven's hand with is own.  Without a look or even a single word passing between them; they started to run.

Houses: <br/>
1. Revin <br/>
2. Trion <br/>
3. Elem <br/>
4. Histri <br/>
5. Yonis <br/>
6. Meme <br/>
7. Brahm <br/>
8. Garvel <br/>
9. Cyrol <br/>
10. Lefra <br/>
11. Olus (Awl-us) <br/>
12. Daymn <br/>
13. Salva <br/>


We are The Observers.  We watch.  We document.  We get the word out.

They are The Houses.  There are twelve known houses, though legend tells of a 13th that once existed.
