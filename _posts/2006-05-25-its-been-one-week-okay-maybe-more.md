Being sick, is really not fun.  I worked from home the last two days because I was sick.

I'm not sure what it is about moving to a new city that makes me seem to be so prone to getting sick.  The same thing happened when I moved to Montreal.  I guess it has something to do with adjusting to the public transportation or maybe some stress I don't notice that is affecting me.

Regardless, it very much sucks.

Ilona and I talked for the first time in a while yesterday.  That definitely cheered me up and made me feel better.  She wrote something new, and it was absolutely amazing.  I was tingling.

Life here has been good overall.  I think next week when Shaun gets here it will be more fun.  It will be nice to have one of my good friends who is my age and still single to drag around the city with me.  It's fun to go wandering around and exploring on your own, but it's better to have a partner in crime to back you up when you see something or something happens that no one will believe.

Tomorrow night a few of us are getting together for dinner.  Yet another friend from my HB days is coming out to Vancouver for a few days.  Someday they'll all end up out here.  He was going to be crashing at my place Friday night because his travel arrangements got messed up, but I heard today they are all sorted out.

At least it will give me a chance to have a couple of beer with the team here at work tomorrow since dinner isn't until 7pm.  I've missed every once a month social team night because of raiding.  Don't get me wrong, I love my raiding, but I need to get to know the team here at work better too.

Holy fricking wow!  They just dropped off a new 23" high definition widescreen flatpanel tv at my desk at work... and hooked up cable for me!  I have tv at work!  How amazingly cool is that?  Pfft.  Good bye 20" crt, you've served me well, may you find peace in your next life at the scrap heap.

The whole week has been like that.  Happy and sad.  Gratifying and frustrating.  Up and down.  Push and pull.
