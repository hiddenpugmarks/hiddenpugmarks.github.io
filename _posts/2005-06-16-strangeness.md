Everything is eternally strange.  I think that&apos;s one of those simple truths I keep hearing about.  My life is eternally strange, and as rollercoastery as ever.

Something very important is almost done and ready for a very important day that is almost here.  It should only take another couple of weeks to finish up I hope.

I finally got some furniture.  Of course, it is only shelving and a closet organizer.  Somehow life likes to hand me all of the things I need in the least convenient order.  Part of the challenge I guess.

It also has a way of saying "Ha ha!  You&apos;ve wanted this for months, maybe even years!  Here are nine but you can only pick one!"  As well as taking away the hope that I live on at some of the worst times, like a kick to the ribs when I&apos;m already down.

Overall life has been going fairly well.  I get to see and hear about how happy everyone around me is, which in turn does make me happy.  It can lead to some late night deep thinking though, where I wonder what it would be like if I could contribute more to their happiness, and why it is that I can&apos;t.

You have to take the good with the bad, and the bad with the good.  I&apos;m pretty sure that&apos;s another one of those simple truths.

Work is still pretty slow and dull.  I&apos;m thinking that if I overcomplicate the problems they are given me to solve, and in turn oversolve them, it might make it interesting enough to challenge me.  I know they have some confidence in my ability, they did give me a task that affected over 6000 files in the project, but even that wasn&apos;t really challenging.  It was just time consuming.

Maybe work is so easy right now because everything else in life is so complicated.  I&apos;d rather change it I think so that life was a challenge and everything else went a little smoother for a while.

*Random Thought* I really want a BBQ!  I just can&apos;t seem to find a convenient way to get a propane tank filled.
