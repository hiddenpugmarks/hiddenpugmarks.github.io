I&apos;ve been a nice guy forever.  Something about it just doesn&apos;t seem to work though.  As far as I can tell, girls don&apos;t want nice guys.

The old saying that nice guys finish last is very wrong.  I&apos;m more in favour of the somewhat modified nice guys get run over by a bus halfway through the race.

Being a nice guy gets me lots of friends.  Lots of girls that like to talk with me and hang out, but none who want to be more.  I&apos;m feeling kind of broken about the whole thing today.

I&apos;m going to keep being a nice guy to everyone I know.  Just because, well, what else could I possibly be?  It&apos;s all I know.  When I move in a few weeks I&apos;m going to give being a nice guy one more shot.  I&apos;m going to keep being me until the end of the summer.

If it doesn&apos;t work out by then, then I&apos;m just going to find a way to stop being me.  It&apos;ll be hard, and it&apos;ll hurt, but I won&apos;t be alone anymore.

It&apos;s funny how such great things happening to me can bring this out in me.  They are great, but they would be so much more amazing if I had someone to share it all with.

*poke* so if you out there reading this, or your friends, or your friends friends, are the one I should share it all with.  Leave a comment :)

I&apos;m going to go eat chocolate and be happy.  This will be revisted again someday I&apos;m sure.
