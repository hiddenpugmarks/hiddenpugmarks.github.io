It isn't often that I read something and a little light bulb goes ding over my head.  It did happen today though.  

I was a reading a blog entry titled <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/03/27/9512420.aspx">I drive a car the way most people use a computer</a> and pretty much palm-smacked my forehead exclaiming "That's exactly how I feel!"
