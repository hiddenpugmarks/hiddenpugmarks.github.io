Hmm, I guess it&apos;s been almost a week.  So hello out there.

Work is done and gone.  At least the job I&apos;ve had for the last four years is done and gone.  It&apos;s time to move on to something new and interesting now.  I&apos;m still not 100% sure what I&apos;ll be working on, but I 99% don&apos;t care :)

I&apos;m not moving because of work.  I didn&apos;t quit my last job because I hated it.  I am moving on because it is the right thing to do for life.  I need things to do.  I need to be in a place where I have options and the opportunity for some spontanaeity.

There is no doubt that I will miss a lot of the friends that I have made here.  They can all come and visit though and see what I&apos;m like when I&apos;m happy.  That is something that has been very rare for a long time.  Plus any of those who want to move on for the same reason, I will help to the best of my ability to move on.

Basically I could go to where I&apos;m going to work and they could put me on the exact same project I&apos;m on now and even though I&apos;d be bored out of my mind, I&apos;d still be happier about everything.  Unless you love your job, you shouldn&apos;t let it make life decisions for you.  Only maybe 2% of the people I know love their job.  That&apos;s great for them!  I however am one of the 98% of the people who just can&apos;t seem to get a job that I absolutely love, so I&apos;ll just do whatever will get the bills paid and allow me to live my life the way I want to.  i.e. HAVE FUN!

My days have been nice and low key lately.  Sleep in, get up, clean the place and prep for moving.  I like life when it is simple.  

I hope the world is treating you all well :)
