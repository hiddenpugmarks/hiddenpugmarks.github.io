Sure, I doubt anyone who reads this will get the reference.  I&apos;m also sure that my brother-in-law would get it in under five minutes.

However, law seven is the way the world should work.  It&apos;s the way the world would work if it were filled with honesty or at the very least honour.  It is the way that parts of the world used to work.

Wars would be decided with a single life, instead of hundreds of thousands or millions.  Life would be simpler.  The world would be simpler.

Heh.  Damn movies and the way they touch me.

Time to go grab another one off the shelf.  It&apos;s going to be a late night I think.  It seems my insomnia has come back to visit me for a while.

I guess I offended the sandman when I slapped him ;)
