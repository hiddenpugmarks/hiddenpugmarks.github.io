So, I picked up a PSP today with Lumines for a game.  I like the game, but I like most puzzle games.  The whole system seems quite nice.  The little analog nub is pretty cool even if I don&apos;t really have a sue for it.  Spiderman 2 which came with it looks phenomenal on the little widescreen display.

The sound is even good.  I wish the headphones and the wrist strap weren&apos;t white, but other than that it is a pretty sweet deal and will go nicely with my Nintendo DS.  I&apos;m looking forward to when Mercury comes out for the PSP in a couple of weeks. It looks cool.

So why did I buy a PSP?  Celebration of course!  I bought an electric shaver as well today.  We&apos;ll see how that works out.  It&apos;s my last ditch effort to curb away from just growing a full beard like I really want to do.  Why?  I guess because you don&apos;t see too many beards around these days.  It&apos;s all clean shaven and goatees.
