So it's all going well so far.  This whole switching jobs and moving across the country thing.

I'm not a huge fan of living in a hotel, but I'm getting by.  At least I found an okay pizza place that delivers to it when I don't make it to the cafeteria at work for supper before it shuts down.

The cafeteria here is flat out amazing!  If you like Stir Fry, Pizza, Ribs, Burgers, Fries, Onion Rings, Salads, Sandwhiches, Soups, umm, yeah, pretty much you name it and it's here.  It's even good food.  Those are just the daily, regular, items you can get.  They also have coolers filled with deserts, racks of Old Dutch Potato chips for munching on, stands of chocolate bars, and of course all of the health choices such as granola bars and muffins, hippie drinks, etc.

I can see why some of my friends have said that they don't really buy groceries anymore.  They just have lunch and supper at the cafeteria and eat out/order in on weekends.

I am still looking for a place to live.  I found a place that I put an application in on, but I haven't heard anything back yet.  I would really like to get this place though.  Now, going out on a limb and saying that, should pretty much mean that I won't get it, but, wow is it ever nice and in a great location :)

All is clear on the western front.  Rain.  Mountains.  Ocean.  City.  It's all good.  Having friends who moved out here ahead of me definitely helps as well.  A few of us went to a place called Shabusen for lunch on Saturday.  It was really good.  I gave sushi another shot, but it failed again.  There was some sesame dressing coated spinach that was good.  It was kind of like eating crunchy peanut butter.  I still can't believe that spinach was made edible.  The rest of the smorgasbord was pretty great as well.

I failed at the chopsticks :(
