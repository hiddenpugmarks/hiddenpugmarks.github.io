Don't let me hold something so delicate
Shattered with a word
Don't say a thing
As we get closer and closer
Damn this is gonna hurt

I see everything differently than every one else.  I really don't know why.  I don't know how I came to see things the way that I do.

Part of me wishes that I didn't see the world the way that I do.  That I could see it the same way that everyone else does so that I could fit in better.  At the same time, I love the way that I see things.  I think that the world is a lot simpler to me in many ways.

This has just sort of been becoming more and more obvious to me lately.  I'm hanging out more with my friends both out here in Vancouver and online in World of Warcraft.  The more I hang out with them the more that it dawns on me how little I really have in common with most of them.  My views on humanity, society, beauty, happiness, life, friendship, honor, love, right down to my taste in movies tends to be quite different.

I'm not complaining about the friendships.  I wouldn't trade them for anything.  I'm glad to know all of these people.  I think in some way these diverse friendships fill a void in my life that I'm not fully aware of.

I'm not exactly sure what the proper word for it is, but I have always been whatever that word is.  I am someone who gives you what you expect out of me.  

If you expect me to be a great listener and a great friend, then that's what I am.  
If you expect me to be an amazing programmer, then that's what I'll be.  
If you expect me to be the uber 1337 tank in WoW, then that's what I'll do.  
If you expect me to be an asshole, then I'll do my best at it.  
If you expect me to be a risk taker, then I'll take risks.  
If you expect nothing of me, I don't know what you get.  Maybe that's when you get the real me.  Whoever that may be.

Rest well this night.
