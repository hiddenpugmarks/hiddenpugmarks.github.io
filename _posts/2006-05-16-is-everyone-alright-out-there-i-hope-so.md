This morning I woke up at 5:15am frozen and shaking. It wasn't actually cold in the apartment or outside.  I tried to cover myself with a mountain of blankets, but it didn't help.  I just couldn't seem to get warm or stop shaking.  Shaking violently to the point that it was hard to get out of bed.

I filled the tub with very hot water, but within five minutes of submersing myself in it; it felt luke warm.  I continued to shake for about 20 more minutes.

It's a scary thing to go through, and it's not the first time it has happened.  It has been happening once in a while since I was in highschool.

There is an odd tie between me getting these freezing shakes and the people I know and care about.  The last time this happened was the day that my friend Ilona was in a car accident.  Usually the worse it is, the worse the problem or the closer the person is to me.

I didn't get any sleep after 5:15am, so I'm running on about three and a half hours of sleep.  I tried to go back to bed at around 8:15am, but my body kept alternating between being too hot and being too cold.  I made it to work though.  Now I just have a massive headache and a sense of uneasiness.

Life is so weird.
