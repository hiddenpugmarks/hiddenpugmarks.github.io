I don&apos;t normally don&apos;t do these sorts of tests, but <a href="http://www.animalinyou.com/survey.asp">this one</a> is interesting:


Apparently I&apos;m an <a href="http://www.animalinyou.com/Owl.htm">Owl</a> or a <a href="http://www.animalinyou.com/Penguin.htm">Penguin</a> or possibly a <a href="http://www.animalinyou.com/Beaver.htm">Beaver</a>

Which one do you think I am?
