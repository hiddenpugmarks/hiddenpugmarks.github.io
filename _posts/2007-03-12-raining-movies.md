This weekend, due to the monsoon, torrential downpour, flood conditions, whatever you like to call it, was a heavily movie themed weekend.

<b><i>300</i></b>
Saturday night Holly and I headed out to see 300.  I had been looking forward to seeing 300 for quite a while, and I must say, it did not disappoint me in any way.

The movie was everything I had hoped for and more.  It has definitely landed a place in my top five movies.  I'm not sure of the exact position yet, but I'll know better after I get to pick it up on DVD and watch it a dozen times.

Reviews:
Holly: It was better than I expected it to be...
Me: That was $#%(#$% awesome!

<b><i>Borat</i></b>

On Sunday we decided to rent some movies.  We picked up Borat because everyone and their dog seems to like it.  It was a piece of pop culture which everyone was making references to when they said things.  We thought we should see it.

All I can say is that it was 85 minutes long, and I would like 80 of those minutes of my life back.  It wasn't funny.  It wasn't interesting.  I can't figure out why people like it.  Maybe I am just too far out of touch with the times.  Although, if being in touch with the times makes Borat funny then I'll just stay out of touch.

Reviews:
Holly & I: The part with the bear was funny...

<b><i>The Departed</i></b>

Now this was a good movie.  It is a continuation of making good movies for Scorcese (who for some reason I frequently confuse with Oliver Stone).  The actors were great.  The story was great.  The ending was... you decide for yourself.

Holly & I: That was a good movie.
