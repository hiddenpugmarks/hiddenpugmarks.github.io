It was a good four day weekend.  No, it was an amazing four day weekend!  Now, next weekend is four days too!

It was really great to see the old gang again.  Hang out on the beach and drink a few beer (too many really) and have a nice barbecue.  I miss the old team, and even the old company to some degree, but I sure don&apos;t miss the small town life.  If I could transport all of that stuff here to Montreal, well, that would be awesome.

I wish I would have been down longer and had more time to talk to everyone.  15 hours just isn&apos;t enough to catchup with so many people.  I hope they all come and visit, just a few at a time though, my place isn&apos;t that big :)

I also hope I get a chance to go back and visit them all again sometime.  I know there are lots of couches out there for me to crash on.

The work late mode is slowly slipping into gear.  I&apos;ve never been a big fan of working late.  It sort of sucks really.  I&apos;m more of a "If it was planned right, I wouldn&apos;t be here" kind of person.

I had my first review at work today.  It seems to have gone well.

Oh, and I got a couch today.  Super-comfy couch!  So comfy I might sleep on it tonight :)

That&apos;s all in the world according to me today.
