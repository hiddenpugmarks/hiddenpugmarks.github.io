Today was that day.  That day that always seems to happen no matter where I go.  That day, where I'm right, my boss is wrong, and we begin to endlessly bump heads (admittedly, we've been bumping heads for a while already).

It drives me absolutely crazy when I have a plan of action to really, I mean REALLY, improve our game and I get shutdown at every turn and told to fix things that aren't broken or clean up other people's messes.  I do enough cleaning up after other people when I'm just waiting for builds to finish.

We could get our reviews higher, please the public more, have a better game and sell more units, but that doesn't seem to be the goal here.  We could be at the very edge of technology, I mean that is why I took this job, but it doesn't appear we will.

I've been very concerned ever since my last boss essentially retired.  Now, it seems those concerns were warranted.  Which, as it stands, really, really sucks.

I used to have the coolest job in the world.  Right now, it just feels like a job.  If all I wanted was to just do a "job" there are lots of other opportunities out there with bigger paychecks and less overtime.

I have always wanted that elusive job that you love to do though.  It has pushed me from place to place all the way across the country.  I found it.  I had it.  Now... it seems to have left.

So what do you do when the dream gets up and walks away?
