My development setup at work is seriously starting to get out of hand.  I'm now up to two Xbox 360s, two 23" widescreen HDTVs, two 19" monitors, and miscellaneous other wired contraptions running all over the place.  It's chaos I tell you!  Chaos!

I wish I could take a picture of it to show everyone.  There's barely enough room on my desk to set down my book when I'm not reading.

I know it won't be long and I'll probably have a PS3 devkit or two wedged in here somewhere with another tv or two as well...
