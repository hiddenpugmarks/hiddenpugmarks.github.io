Well, I'm back from my trip home for Thanksgiving.  It all seemed to go really well.  I think everyone likes Holly.  Which is really good news :)

It was great to see the family.  The food was fantastic!  The scenery was much nicer than I remember, which I guess is how it always is.

The Tim Horton's was much better back east as well.  I'm not sure what they put in it, but mmm, mmm, good!

I got to see my nephew who I haven't seen since last Christmas.  He sure has grown up a lot.  

I was amazed at the differences in property values between the east coast and the west coast.  Out on the east coast something I could get for 75k is probably worth 500k+ out here.  It seems a little ridiculous really.  All of the property values out here really make me wonder sometimes...

This morning I went to the bank and talked a few things over with them.  It sure did take a long time.  I think I'm going to consolidate all of my various student loans into a single loan that I can pay back at my own pace (which should be significantly faster than with student loans).

Oh, and one last thing, I finally got to try Papa Jonh's Pizza.  It is quite simply fantastic.  It is the best pizza I have ever had, and when I say that it carries a certain amount of authority with it.  They even have garlic cheese fingers, but instead of being the patented "swimming in grease" of Pizza Delight, they are just perfect.

Other than that, I'm in love and life is grand :)
