The word tired quite simply isn't a big enough word to describe how I feel right now.  Exhausted barely even scratches the surface.

I think I may suffer from an as yet undiagnosed disease that I will dub Awakeaholism.  So let me start by saying, "Hi.  I'm Sean.  I'm an Awakeaholic.  It's been... I'm not sure how long since I've had a good night's rest."

You see, I'm awake a lot.  Even when I don't want to be.  I have no real control over it.  Sometimes I just can't stop being awake for extended periods of time.

Take last night as a perfect example.  Around 10pm I started thinking "Gee, I should go to bed and get a good night's sleep to start the week with."  Then I watched the hours tick by.  11pm.  Midnight.  1am.  2am.  3am.  4am.  Around 4:30am I went to sleep.  My last thought was "*insert explitive of choice* tomorrow is going to be hell."

So what happened next?  I woke up just after 6am (just a little before my alarm).  I've been up ever since.  Even when I "woke up" I wasn't tired.  All day since then though, I have been tired.  Not the kind of tired where you can sleep though.  I know tonight I'll go home, beyond exhausted as I am, and still not be able to sleep.  The later the night continues, the more awake and alert I'll become.

Time to go home for the day I think.  Maybe I'll just go straight to bed and see what happens.
