Have you ever heard of a six word novel?  I hadn't until a couple of days ago.

It turns out that <a href="sixwords.mcgill.ca">McGill University</a> is trying to bring them back.  The story goes that Hemingway was once asked in an interview to write a story in just six words that would tell a complete story.  After he wrote, supposedly he referred to it as his greatest work.

<blockquote>
For sale: baby shoes, never worn.
- Hemingway
</blockquote>

There was also a challenge to do the same thing that went out to a lot of science fiction and fantasy authors.  Since I know that many of you who read this blog are fans of Joss Whedon, here is his effort:

<blockquote>
Gown removed carelessly. Head, less so.
- Joss Whedon
</blockquote>

I took a few minutes and came up with a few of my own.

<blockquote>
End of the Universe.  Bring popcorn.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
He lifted the cup; a champion.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
They wanted peace.  They got war.
</blockquote>

And last but not least, poking a little fun at the whole thing:

<blockquote>
Six words.  One too many.
</blockquote>

You should post some of your own creations in the comments!
