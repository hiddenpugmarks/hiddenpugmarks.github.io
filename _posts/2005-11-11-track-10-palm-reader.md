So apparently I slacked yesterday and I didn&apos;t get my entry done.  So that means today will be a double dose.

"It&apos;s so good, to believe..."

I have no idea what this song is really about.  I know what it means to me though.  That line quoted above is the one that really hits home.  It is so good to believe.

I have a great appreciation for people who believe.  I believe in my friends and my family.  I believe in myself.  I can&apos;t seem to believe in those big vaporous things that so many seem to be able to believe in though.

I tried believing in God.  I wanted to.  I wasn&apos;t able to though.  I am drawn to people who are believers in things like that.  People with faith.  I think I&apos;m drawn to them because I want to understand how to develop something like that.  How can I gain this sense of being tied to something greater and all important?

How can I learn to pray away my sins?

I hope my children can find this type of faith.  It seems like a wonderful source of personal strength.

When I failed to find God in my life and in my ways, I found faith in people.  I believe in people.  I believe that everyone I meet is a good person deep down inside until the prove me wrong.

I learned how to find the good in each person.  I also learned how to find the good inside of every situation no matter how bad it may seem.  Sometimes there isn&apos;t any saving grace for something that seems bad, but there usually is.

If you happen to find your faith in Palm Readers, so be it.  I don&apos;t really believe in it, but my sister does.  The palm readers/tea leave readers/psychics that she visits once a year are eerily accurate quite often though.  Especially this year.

They knew that a younger man in her life had moved for a new job recently and had a health scare.  That aptly describes my year.  This person she saw also said that this younger man would find everything he was looking for where he was now.  So hope against hope, dangerous weapon that it is, I want to believe in that.

I want to believe that I will find everything that I am looking for here in Montreal.

Alas, I&apos;m not a believer in fortune telling or God.  Just myself and those around me.  So I will not let my hopes rise high enough to cut me down.

Tune in later today for "Self Righteous".
