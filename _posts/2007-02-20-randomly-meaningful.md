The sky is blue with a fist full of white to grey gradient mottled clouds.  It is beautiful.  I don't think that I've ever been happy to see the sun before.  I honestly have to say that I have missed the blue roof on this room called Vancouver.

Don't get me wrong, I like the grey sky too.  However, the grey sky is a thoughtful sky.  It is an introspective sky.  It can start to weigh heavily on the soul.  The blue sky is fun and bright.  Even the sun seems beautiful, though as we all know <i>it is out to kill me</i>.

Last weekend Holly was away winter camping, which left me with a void of time to fill.  I ended up playing World of Warcraft.  It was pretty amazing, it actually felt like old times.  Much more fun than it had been during the last couple of months that I had played before my hiatus.  It was great to hang out with some of the old crew and go through some of the new 5-man content with them.  It was very easy to slip back into the roll of tanking.

The really funny part of it all to me was that initially while leveling from 60-70 I had a hard time getting help from people in the guild.  Some of my good friends in there did help me out along the way though which was nice.  However after I hit 70 and decided it was time to start doing some dedicated instancing, I respecced to Protection.  After the guild heard I was protection again the offers to go in groups have been flying in.

In other completely unrelated news, I found out today that I work in the same city that Joe Sackic was born in.  THE Joe Sackic!  The same guy who scored his 600th goal in the NHL last night... Man, that is cool.

I'm looking forward to moving in with Holly soon.  It's going to be great to get to see her every day :)  There are certain things that I'm going to miss about living in the heart of downtown, like being able to go next door to the grocery store, across the street to the theatre, or three to five blocks to anything else.  It is all pretty insignificant though, since I miss Holly more.  

I think what it really comes down to is that I've been on my own for so long that I've grown very used to being independant.  It's kind of strange how life seems to go.  You start out with your family and you are dependant on them for almost everything.  Then you jump out into the world and try to figure out how to be independant.  Then after you've figured that out you meet someone and settle down a little.  You have to unlearn some of your independance and learn to let that person in.  You have to learn to depend on them and to be there for them to depend on too.  It all boils down to no longer being independant, which is a really wonderful thing.
