So I&apos;m here.  Why?  Someone knows :)

The life I live is a roller coaster of epic proportions.  I love my life, I hate my life.  I love my job, I hate my job.  Up and down with an occasional roll.

I&apos;ve worked where I am now since university.  I&apos;ve gone as far up the corporate chain as I can and I&apos;ve run out of challenges.  Due to these roadblocks I&apos;ve started looking for a new job and I&apos;ve had some interest.

I always interview well.  I&apos;ve hardly ever met anyone I can&apos;t be friendly with or find a way to win over.  So that part of the process is easy, and it did go smoothly.  Then comes the technical part (I&apos;m a programmer) and wow, just fucking WOW do those tests every get scary sometimes!  There are just so many areas of programming and programming related knowledge in this world that you can&apos;t really prepare.

I just had a test that covered everything from predicate calculus to UML.  From 3D math to proper use of breakpoints.  Algorithms to data representation.  It had almost everything I could have imagined.

I don&apos;t know how I did.  I&apos;m anxious about it, and that&apos;s weird.  I don&apos;t get anxious.  Anxious means that I want it.  That I want this job and everything it means on some deep deep level.  That means if I don&apos;t get it I&apos;ll be depressed and if I get it I&apos;ll be scared.

Big changes are scary.  The world is down-right scary.  Change is progress though, and I need some progression.

Anyway, so here I am.  This is me and this is where I&apos;ll try and be.  How often will I update? Haha, I have no idea.  Whenever the mood strikes I guess.
