This past weekend I started packing.  I only managed to pack up six boxes worth of DVDs.  Just a couple more boxes of those to go.

Somehow this step of packing has finally made the upcoming move real.  I'm excited and apprehensive and over joyed and all sorts of feelings over it.  Really I can't wait for it to be over and get to spend more time with Holly :)

The big stress for me in relation to the move, and everything else lately has been money.  I have been living beyond my means for too long it seems.  So it's time to button down for a while.  I was crunching numbers yesterday in relation to how much money I spend at work and... I figured it out to be close to $3000 a year just on lunches and snacks.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Isn't that just sickening?  With some minor shifts I'm pretty sure I can drop that by 80%.

I've started playing some X360 hockey in anticipation of the playoffs.  It's just that time of year.  The air is filled with hockey.  This is one of those many moments that it is great to be living in Canada, where everyone is talking hockey.  Even the people who don't really know anything about hockey are talking about the Canucks around the city.

I on the other hand am talking about the Red Wings, oh and sometimes that 11 game losing streak that the Oilers are on after getting rid of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Smyth">Ryan Smyth</a> (Kevin Lowe should get fired for that...).  It was like Colorado letting Joe Sackic go, or Detroit letting Steve Yzerman go back when he was playing.  You can't throw away the heart of your team over a few hundred thousand dollars.  They would have made that all back in the first round of the playoffs.  Unfortunately, now they won't make the playoffs.

Let the random rambling continue...

Work has been growing increasingly frustrating for me lately.  I had a realy great week a couple of weeks ago when my TD was away on a trip.  Now that he's back though everything is becoming more and more frustrating.  More than once he has randomly blamed my work for issues that show up in the game, even though so far my code has only ever been found to be at fault once that I can think of.  We're somewhere in the ballpark of 27 me, 1 him; and yet I still always seem to be the first to blame.  It is reaching the point where I really do wonder, Is it personal?  The real kicker is how much development time I lose proving my work that exists works perfectly.

I've already decided, assuming no promotion, that if he is working on this title again next year that I'll be switching teams.  Whether that means leaving the studio or not is still as of yet undecided.  As much as I love the game I'm working on, the frustration just isn't worth it.

And with that I'll stop my ranting.  I'll save my rantings on software development processes for a later date.
