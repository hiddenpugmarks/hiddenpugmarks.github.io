Today has been what the natives call "One of <i>those</i> days."

I got to work today and went to pick up my bus pass, only to find that someone else had already come along and picked it up using my name.  You see, now that's just cheap.  Why on earth would an employee try and steal someone else's employee discounted pass?  It is a redefinition of low down dirty scoundrel.

Initially they told me that they would have to investigate it and find out what happened; and that they would get int ouch with me soon.  So at that point I was thinking very unhappy thoughts to myself.  I splurged for the three zone pass which is a bit pricy.  I figured since we get tax breaks on them now that it would all work out for the best.

So noon rolled around and I hadn't heard anything back yet.  I went back down to talk to them, as it is true that if you want something done right you have to do it yourself, oh, and you have to badger the bejesus out of people too.  They couldn't figure out what happened.  In the end they are going to send someone out this afternoon to go pick another one up for me.

So thanks to the generosity of the company trying to help the employee's with discounted transit passes, they are out the cost of a pass.  If this kind of thing were to start happening often, what would there motivation be to continue offering it?

It really does only take one bad apple to spoil a basket.

Now some thoughts on the second round of the playoffs:
1) Will the Canucks ever play the full 60 minutes of a game?
2) Where did this Ottawa Senators team come from and what did they do with the pods?
3) Can this banged up Red Wings team take down the high flying... err, fast swimming... Sharks?
4) Holly damn!  Look at those Rangers go!

At this point I would have to pick an Ottawa vs Anaheim Stanley Cup Final.  Hockey doesn't need that.  They need some teams that people like, watch, and most importantly, have heard of.

I would have thought that most people have heard of Ottawa, but the other day I was watching "Are You Smarter Than A 5th Grader?" and they asked a woman what country is north of the United States, and she got it wrong.  It's a great show.  It's amazing to be reminded of how much I once knew that I have now forgotten or deliberately pushed aside to make room for more important information.
