Long drives by yourself I have to think are inherently bad.  You're just stuck there; trapped in a metal box.  Very quickly you find yourself running out of things to do.

Thus was my case this morning.  You see, what appears to be a group of homeless people "accidentally" set one of our major bridges on fire this weekend.  So now that bridge is closed.  So now all of that traffic (80,000 cars a day), well, it has to go somewhere else.

I discovered this morning that all of that traffic has apparently decided to divert itself to <i>my</i> bridge.  Unfortunately, <i>my</i> bridge is already pretty much at capacity.

So on this long drive I listened to an Audiobook for a while.  A little over an hour.  I listened to the radio for a bit.  I flipped through a mapbook looking for an alternative route.  Then, well then I was tired of those things and I ran out of things to do.  At first I got frustrated, then I got calm, finally I got bored again.

I find it is always at these moments that I start asking myself, what do I really want to do?

That is both a fundamental and an epic question.  We all ask ourselves that from time to time.  Sometimes in the context of what do I want to watch on TV next?  What do I want for supper?  Once in a while though it is in that grander epic sense of "What do I want to do with my life?"

I know for certain, that sitting in a car for up to three hours a day travelling one way to work definitely isn't it.  So what is it?  Good question.

I like a lot of things.  I have a lot of interest.  Most of them involve some form or other of data manipulation.  I like to chart things and organize things.  I like to write code that does useful <i>stuff</i>.  Yes, <i>stuff</i>.  I really can't get much clearer than that.

In a perfect world I would be able to work from home completely on my own schedule.

On the flip side, in these times of economic turmoil; I am happy just to have a job.  Almost 300 game developers in Vancouver alone have been let go in the last couple of weeks.
