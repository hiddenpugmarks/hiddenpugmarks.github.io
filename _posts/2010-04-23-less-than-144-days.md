So it has been less than 144 days.  Just in case you were counting.  Or even thinking of counting.  I know it is hard to believe.

The weekend is nearly here.  This weekend I'm on my own for Saturday.  Holly and friends are heading south of the border for a very busy day of shopping.  What am I going to be doing?  I expect 10-12 solid hours of playing games and hopefully continuing to celebrate the Red Wings victory that should happen tonight.

Oh, and most important of all; I plan to not work.  It's always nice to take a break.

So, what else has been going on?  That is a really good question.  There have been some good things and some not so good things.  We went out for lunch with some friends at a cool little place called Burgoo.  They serve "international comfort food".  Mostly it was just cool to go out and do something with friends.  It has been far too long.

We went to the drive-in.  A great, and nearly extinct, form of entertainment.  We saw Kick-Ass which was remarkably better than I expected it to be.  There had been a ton of negative reviews about it, but based on seeing the movie I don't think the reviewers watched the whole thing.

Our infamous black cat King Leonidus killed the laptop.  It was his latest victim in a long line of unfortunate victims.  He has killed a TV, a laptop, several glass/crystal pitchers, jugs and vases, even an electric heater with a Wii sensor bar.  The cat has mad skillz!

That's pretty much it.  I just wanted to be sure to put something here rather than not.  I spent far too long away from my blog and I need to turn it back into a habit.

Have a great weekend world!
