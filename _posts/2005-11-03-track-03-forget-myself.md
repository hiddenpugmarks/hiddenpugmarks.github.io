Excerpts from the song:
"Who&apos;s that guy?  I don&apos;t know."
...
"Should have watched my step
Cause I keep on forgetting myself
And I keep on forgetting myself
Who am I we both don&apos;t know"
...
"This is not my life or maybe it is 
I keep on forgetting myself"


Sometimes we forget ourselves.  We lose sight of who we are.  What we want, and what we need.

It might be a new friend or a new love that starts it all.  You slip into a new world.  You hang out with new people.  You go to new places.  You eat new foods.  You exist during new waking ours.  It could be any one of the aforementioned things or all of them or a blend of other changes.

You get swept up into this new life.  It seems wild and exciting because it is different.  You feel so happy to have been given this chance at change.  Slowly you start to drift away from things you used to know.  

A space starts to grow between you and your best friends.  You&apos;re family starts to slip away into the distance.  They keep asking you why you changed.  Somehow you rationalize it all as them being jealous of your new life.  

Then one day you wake up and you&apos;re not smiling any more.  The world seems a little bit "off".  Something is definitely amiss.  You can&apos;t quite place your finger on it.  You continue to go through the routine that has developed.  You don&apos;t quite enjoy everything as much as you remember though.

Sometimes a relationship can consume you.  A relationship is supposed to be a merger, not a take over.  When you make new friends or find a new love you are supposed to share your time.  You spend time with their friends.  They spend time with your friends.  Maybe your friends and their friends become friends.

The real problem is that when you get caught up in it all and you forget yourself, those new people tend to forget you too.  They forget you, because you aren&apos;t you anymore.  They drift away and you&apos;re left alone.

You can always go back to your family.  That&apos;s what family is.  Love them or hate them.  They are always there.  That extends to true friends.  Those friends that know they can call you if their life is out of control.  They call you if they&apos;ve had a rough day because they know you&apos;ll bring ice cream.  Of course that works both ways.  Those friends that ARE family will always find a way to forgive and forget your self that you became.

I forget myself sometimes.  As mentioned above and in other ways.  I forget who I am.  I forget what I stand for.  I never forget who I love.  I sometimes lose myself when I&apos;m not sure what to do with my feelings.  In that lost sense I am forgotten.  Forgotten to myself.

Don&apos;t forget yourselves.

Tune in tomorrow for "Danger".
