Yesterday started off really poorly.  By the end of the day things were going really well though :)

It all started off with the student loan people and the goverment messing me over as usually.  About a year ago they integrated two of my student loans into a single loan.  Well, that sucked.  I had to reschedule payments etc.  Recently they de-integrated the loan back into two individual loans, and they didn't tell me :p  I wasn't aware of this until I applied for a line of credit and it got turned down because of some outstanding payments needing to be made on one of the sperated loans.  The part that really drives me up the wall over this is that I have the money in the bank to completely pay off the whole loan, but it has already marred my credit it seems.

I had to take a day off work and spend hours on the phone getting it all sorted out.  At one point I literally spent 23 conescutive minutes bouncing around their automated phone system.

The good points of the day were very good though.  When it was over with the student loan people I went back to bed for a couple of hours.  I decided it was an order-in night and ordered in some pizza which was pretty good.  Then in World of Warcraft our raid group got our first Nefarian kill!  To top it all off he dropped the Breastplate of Wrath, my 8th and final piece for my Wrath armor.  After all of that, when I got fully buffed and used all of my trinkets and abilities I broke 15,000 hit points :D
