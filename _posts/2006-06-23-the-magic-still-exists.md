Is it done?  Is it ready?

Mada, mada dane. (No, not yet.)

I've cut our loading times down from 5 minutes to 65 seconds.  Everyone else is happy with it.  They've taken it off of the risks list. 

But I can feel it.  Hell, I can taste it.  There is another 25 seconds out there waiting to be found.  It's right there.  Tantalizingly close.  It's teasing and taunting me.  

I will not give up yet!

I will not surrender to being average.

* the day ticks on until the eureka moment *

There will be no average today.  

We are officially better than average at this moment in time.  37.5s (even one scrunched all the way down to 34.7s with some adjustments ).  The goal for the end of the project was 45s.  Yet today, this week, this time of code miracles; I found a way to break even my own theoretical limits on how fast we could load.

The best part is... I can feel that there is more time to be shaved off.  I want to see 30s.  I want to see it so bad.

Mwuhahaha!

* brief pause after a moment of delirious laughter and a celebratory Dr. Pepper *

The things that I do best, are always the things that people tell me I can't.
