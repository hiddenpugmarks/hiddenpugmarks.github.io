Company is about friendship.  It&apos;s about how your significant views your friends.  It&apos;s about how you get in trouble for hanging out with your friends because they&apos;re considered to be "Bad Company" by your significant other.

I really can&apos;t say that I have a lot of experience with that.  So this will be a very short entry.  It&apos;s the only song on the album that I can&apos;t relate deeply to on some level.

My friends are just so laid back and cool, that I can&apos;t imagine someone not being able to get along with them.  At least, it hasn&apos;t happened yet.

Some of them are a little whacked, no doubt, but they&apos;re all good people.

And next, the final track "Good Man".
