I was standing on the SkyTrain today just minding my own business on the mind numbing trip to work this morning, when an old friend stepped into the car.  He looked at me and said "The grape vine has been talking to me about you."

That damn grape vine.  It just goes and goes.  I swear, I have told almost no one that I was leaving my current job to go back to my old job; but everyone knows.

Most of them even know what I'm working on and who I'll be working with.  Hell, even <i>I</i> didn't know for sure who I would be working with.

Since the world at large seems to know then this probably isn't news to anyone reading this, but yes, the rumours are true; I am leaving my current company to return to my old company.

This has been an <i>"educational"</i> experience.  I am very much looking forward to returning to my old post, even with the pay cut and the reduction in vacation time.

I'll be working on something new, exciting, and completely unannounced.  I plan to work there forever and ever and ever; or until I am in a position to either work for myself or to work at one or two select startups that may or may not happen over the course of the next couple of decades.

I'm going to hack away at a new toy engine at home that will be used for the three games I have in the design and prototyping phases.

If anyone has a suggestion for a name for the engine, I'd love to hear it.  So far in the past I have written the following engines never to be released:

<ol>
<li>Cebidae
</li><li>LiquidSpace
</li><li>Orion
</li></ol>
