Whatever it was, it&apos;s still not quite all the way down.

Apparently it was Vietnamese food.  I&apos;ve never had it before today and it was an interesting experience.  My mouth liked it, but my body is still undecided (but leaning toward no).

I mean hey, chicken with spicy peanut sauce IS tasty.  Whatever I had for desert was also tasty.  I&apos;m not sure what it was.  It looked like a clear form of row in a bowl of milk and sugar with a couple slices of banana, and it tasted like banana bread.  However, eating the gelatinous clear bubbles (which I am assuming are row) was a weird, weird, WEIRD experience for me.

I don&apos;t normally think of fish eggs when I think of desert.  I guess that makes me uncultured?
