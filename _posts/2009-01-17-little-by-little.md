Little by little, I'm getting used to being back at work.  This Christmas was the longest break that I've had in a long, long time.  It made me realize just how much I wish I could do my own thing.  Don't get me wrong, I love my job, when it doesn't consist of ten and twelve hour days; but it would be really nice to get to sleep in once in a while and work on something that is 100% what I want to do.

Little by little the year is progressing along.  Is it really the third week of 2009 already?  When did that happen?  I guess it must have been sometime between the mountains of snow and the thick as smoke fog that has been plaguing us in the land of rain.

Driving home late every night in the fog is a harrowing journey.

Little by little, Holly and I are consuming every TV series created in both North America and the UK.  At least the good ones.  We currently have 62 TV series stored on an external hard drive and served up on demand to our entire network, including over the Xbox 360.  Although, we're almost out of space on that drive.  750GB just doesn't seem to go as far as it used to.

Little by little I'm building a framework around some ideas in my head that I hope to write about.  If there is ever time.  Which of course there never is.  People always say that if things are important to you that you just need to make time to do them.  I guess that I just have way too many things that are important to me, because it is hard to eke out any extra time in my schedule to do things.

Little by little the economy is going to hell.  You see, I finally forayed into the stock market, and it crashed.  Just like that.  Quite literally I bought my first few stocks, sold them a few days later, and then the market crashed the next day.

Other than that, things have been fairly nice and normal.  Just the way I like it.
