I closed my eyes and typed every word that came out.  I guess that makes this stream-of-consciousness poetry.

catch me<br/>
I&apos;m falling<br/>
touch me<br/>
I&apos;m fading<br/>
feel me<br/>
before I disappear<br/>
make me<br/>
be solid again<br/>
save me<br/>
make me real<br/>
I don&apos;t know<br/>
how to change<br/>
I want to<br/>
I want to end these games<br/>
so touch me<br/>
before I fade away<br/>
maybe you&apos;ll save me<br/>
maybe I will fall anyway<br/>
at least<br/>
we will know<br/>
the way it all works<br/>
why the pain grows<br/>
there has to be<br/>
so much more<br/>
here for us<br/>
before the storm<br/>
I can&apos;t<br/>
keep on pretending<br/>
that I don&apos;t<br/>
love you<br/>
like the morning<br/>
and the rainbows<br/>
I can&apos;t <br/>
pretend that<br/>
I hate you<br/>
that I&apos;m crying for her<br/>
when the salty tears<br/>
are falling from my eyes<br/>
like raindrops<br/>
falling form saddened skies<br/>
and they&apos;re falling for you<br/>
falling for us<br/>
for all of this<br/>
broken trust<br/>
I just<br/>
want to love you<br/>
to love you<br/>
to be loved by you<br/>
my heart<br/>
is open<br/>
and beating<br/>
and bloodfilled<br/>
my heart<br/>
is growing<br/>
it&apos;s strengthening<br/>
for the fall<br/>
that comes with fading<br/>
please touch me<br/>
I need to feel you<br/>
I need to feel me<br/>
instead of feeling this<br/>
I can&apos;t rest<br/>
no matter what I do<br/>
I can&apos;t stop the voices<br/>
no matter what I think<br/>
I just want<br/>
to crawl<br/>
right out<br/>
of my skin<br/>
and see what<br/>
is there <br/>
beating within<br/>
so touch me<br/>
I&apos;m fading<br/>
I&apos;m about to fall<br/>
I&apos;m raining<br/>
my soul<br/>
my heart<br/>
all of me<br/>
every part<br/>
the emotions and feelings<br/>
the cosmic dealings<br/>
they are ending now<br/>
I can&apos;t seem to find<br/>
my way out <br/>
of this rat trap<br/>
of this horrible<br/>
place I&apos;m at<br/>
I&apos;m falling<br/>
I&apos;m fading<br/>
I&apos;m breaking<br/>
no, I&apos;m broken<br/>
I don&apos;t know where<br/>
to go from here<br/>
I just want to feel<br/>
solid and real<br/>
like a wooden boy<br/>
that&apos;s been made to feel<br/>
and his painted tears<br/>
are falling for real<br/>
so help me<br/>
save me<br/>
is that too much to ask<br/>
am I really worth so little<br/>
when you mean<br/>
the world to me<br/>
every single thing<br/>
I taste your words<br/>
with every breath<br/>
and I feel your skin<br/>
in the kiss of the winter wind<br/>
as it brushes me<br/>
like a boy, not a man<br/>
I can only feel you<br/>
inside of me, outside of me<br/>
somewhere I cannot see<br/>
let&apos;s hop into the car<br/>
let&apos;s drive to where we are<br/>
like we used to do<br/>
when we loved wildly<br/>
in our youth<br/>
come on baby<br/>
come to me<br/>
I&apos;ve always been here<br/>
and I always will be<br/>
I can&apos;t move on<br/>
when the best thing is behind me<br/>
I can&apos;t be strong<br/>
when you&apos;ve given up on me<br/>
so touch me<br/>
before I fade away<br/>
feel me<br/>
make me real<br/>
change this clay to flesh<br/>
change this wood to bone<br/>
make me whole<br/>
