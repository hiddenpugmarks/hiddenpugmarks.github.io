I&apos;m feeling kind of low on blood this morning.  I went to have a blood test.  It was the first time I&apos;ve ever had blood drawn.  I&apos;m 25, can you believe it?

It hurt.  Not a lot, but it did hurt.  It was disturbing to look over when I was done and see seven vials of various sizes filled with my blood laying on the table beside me.

Somehow the sight of the blood triggered a response in me that put me into a wild cold sweat.  The nurse asked if I was okay and I said "Yeah, I&apos;m fine.  That&apos;s just a lot of my blood over there and it&apos;s in the wrong place.  It&apos;s supposed to be inside of me."

To which she said "It&apos;s really not that much."

I&apos;m going to try and start focusing more at work.  This past week has been mostly a write-off.  I&apos;ve gotten things accomplished, but not at the same lightning speed as normal.  I think it has to do with a lack of passion for what I&apos;m working on.  I really need to start my own company I think.  Middleware development seems the place to be.  It&apos;s only about a 120 million dollar industry right now, but analysts say it will get up to almost a half billion in the next 10 years.

I could use a piece of that action.  It would be some pretty things in nice places.  Of course I&apos;m the kind of guy that if I made 5+ million I&apos;d retire.  Who needs work when there are so many better things to do?
