Today in goold old Montreal it is raining.  It is freezing raining.  The sidewalks are currently a way to weed out the weak among the population.  Those who do not have balance will die and be removed from the race via the survival of the fittest rule.

Streets everywhere were closed down.  Jammed full with traffic or blocked off by police barricades.  I have never seen anything like it since moving here.  Several of the high traffic streets were closed; Pins, Penfield, Atwater.  It&apos;s just "le fou".

Normally it takes me 15-20 minutes to get to work when I hop a cab.  Today it took almost an hour.  I took a cab because I was unwilling to break my neck on the ice.

People were actually walking down the street between lanes of traffic because it was safer to do that, than it was to use the sidewalks.  At one point I almost had the cab driver stop and let me out.  I was thinking about just hopping the metro home and calling in "sick" due to weather.

Oh well, at least the craziness of the world takes my mind off the crazyiness of life for a while.
