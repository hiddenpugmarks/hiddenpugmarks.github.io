I almost bought a webcam today.  I&apos;m not sure why.  I don&apos;t like having my picture taken in any form; analog or digital, moving or still.  Now, the fact that the whole purpose of a webcam is to take pictures of yourself, it just makes it seem ludicrious that I would even think about buying one.

But...

There&apos;s always a but.  It was shiny, and new, and I don&apos;t have one.  Those are three good reasons to get one in my book.  Thankfully I didn&apos;t by one, but I think I&apos;m going to cave the next time I see one.  What will I do with it?  Hook it up to my computer, use it for a couple of days and never turn it on again?  Like the rest of my geek toys?

Yeah, probably...

My living room is almost fully functional now.  TV and surround sound is good to go.  Game systems and DVD player are hooked up.  Couches are in place.  I&apos;ve decided I need a third couch now though.  Hopefully it will be here in the next couple of weeks.

I&apos;m still not sure what to do with the rest of room though.  It still seems so empty.  I think I just need to find some things to put up on the walls.
