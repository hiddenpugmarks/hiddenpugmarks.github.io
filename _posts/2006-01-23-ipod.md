So I decided today that I&apos;m going to buy an iPod?  Why?  Meh.  No reason more than I want one I guess.

So when I do get it, I&apos;m going to have it engraved.  What I&apos;m looking for are some suggestions on what to get it engraved with.  The engraving&apos;s maximum space consists of two lines which are each a maximum of 27 characters.  So that&apos;s up to a ~54 character engraving max.

Fire away with suggestions :)
