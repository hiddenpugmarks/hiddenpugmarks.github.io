Ahh!  Tonight was a good night.  A good solid 10 hours of drinking can do wonders for the soul sometimes.  Especially when the right people are around :)

I definitely had too much to drink.  That is a rare and wondrous occasion.  A friend brought a bottle of good tequila, and I got to know it well.  Who will I ever drink tequila with when I move?  Those are big shoes to fill.

After the 10 hours of drinking, lots of talking, lots of gaming, lots of fun.  Somehow I wandered out into public with a different friend and we bought supplies for breakfast.  I then proceeded to head back and cook breakfast for everyone who was awake and wanted it or who could be awakened.  I was a little concerned about the breakfast, but I guess it went well since they paid me for it when all was said and done.  Haha, I would so have done it for free.  

I was all ready to cook up a mean desert too!  A nice peach pie, but we couldn&apos;t find any peaches while out and about.  That was probably a good thing, because I probably shouldn&apos;t cook too much while still so drunk.

While I write this entry I am drinking lots and lots of water to rehydrate myself before going to pass out for a while.  There is still much to do today, and for the rest of my time here for that matter.

Ilona, we should talk.  Tonight was good in other ways as well.  Very talk-worthy ways :)

The sheep are beckoning.  I must sleep.  Happy everything everyone!
