For the September long weekend Holly and I rented a cabin on Pitt Lake and headed out of the city leaving everything behind.  All in all it was quite a good time, but we had our doubts about it being a good idea after we arrived.

So it all started out at the dock, as all island adventures do.  The water was so low that they couldn't even get us in to the "main" dock, so we had to trudge through some mud.

Now, we didn't expct the dock to be next to the junk yard.  This sight sort of gave us a little concern about what was in store for us this weekend.

As we were hiking into the cabin we saw this.  This destroyed cabin gave us a little more hesitation.

Then we went past a cabin that didn't look too bad and a little faith was restored.  Not a lot though.

Then we encountered a set of steps out of nowhere.  I mean, you should really always expect to see a flight of stairs out in the middle of the forest right?

At the top of the stops we at last saw our cabin and were quite a bit relieved that it wasn't nearly as rundown as we had been worrying after seeing the other destroyed cabins and the junk yard.

A brief turn around the deck to see the view.

The inside looked not too bad.  A futon on the left, a propane fridge and stove at the back, a table and sink to the right.

Then of course the eye is drawn upward along a blue cord with a wad of duct tape on the end and the railing seen above that.

So we approach the rabbit hole.

Find a ladder.

Unfurl it to it's terrible creaky and wobbly length.

Then climb up it to find the terribly small and cramped second bed.  "The Cabin Sleeps Four"?  Hardly.

Oh, and how could I forget Jay?  This is Jay.

Jay likes pistachios(<i>Pistacia vera</i>). (A brief aside.  Pistachios are not actually nuts.  They are fruit with an elongated seed.)  Jay stole all kinds of our pistachios (okay, maybe we put some out for him).  He even got his gang together and brought them along.  The name of the gang would of course be the Jays :p

Now when we first saw the Jay I thought it might be a blue jay, but it didn't look like any other blue jay I had seen.  So, being me, I had to do some research.  It turns out that Jay is actually a Steller's Jay (which happens to be the provincial bird of British Columbia).

Here is a picture of Holly and I chilling on the deck.

How was everyone else's long weekend?
