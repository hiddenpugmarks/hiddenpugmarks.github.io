It&apos;s been an interesting morning so far.  I accidentally smucked this girl on the metro in the face as I was getting out of the car.  I feel so bad about it :(  I apologized for it, but still, it was a stupid mistake.

I need more sleep.. zzzzz...

I stayed my first night in my new apartment.  I can&apos;t wait to get all of the boxes open and there contents stored in appropriate places.  I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll end up just jamming some of them into closets temporarily, and I have no shortage of closet space.

I really look forward to getting some blinds.  I waved at someone at the air canada center from my apartment last night, and I&apos;d swear they waved back.  Oh well, I&apos;ll add blinds to the list of things I need to buy :)
