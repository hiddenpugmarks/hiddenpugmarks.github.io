So dinner was wonderful.  I was very late, but it was still very wonderful.  Work crept up on me as it has a tendency to do.  The proverbial shit hit the proverbial fan at the proverbial wrong moment.

Holly said she understood, but I still felt bad.  I mean, it was the first dinner she ever cooked for me and I was late.

To go with the amazing chicken were roast vegetables (carrots, celery, parsnip), microwaved corn on the cob (really, really good), green bean casserole, rolls and gravy.  I washed it all down with chocolate milk and a Heineken.  Kisses for dessert.  

Needless to say, it was all amazing and I hope there are many more dinners in our future.
