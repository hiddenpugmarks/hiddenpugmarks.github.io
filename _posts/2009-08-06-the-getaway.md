Things sure haven't been ideal at work lately.  If you read the gaming news you'll know that the project I've been working on (which I won't mention here) has been put on hold.  As part of this change I've been moved to a new project.  A project that I have zero interest in.

I hate times like these.  Going from something great to something terrible.

On the plus side, it means that I got my compensation time a little earlier than planned and I have enjoyed having the week off.  We headed over to Salt Spring Island for the long weekend, and it was fantastic.  They have one of the top rated Farmer's Markets in Canada, and it definitely lived up to the billing.  We love food, and it surely delivered.

We also had fun touring around the island.  I think I could have stayed there forever.  It reminded me a lot of small town life, and how in some ways I really miss that.  I miss being in a community of friendly people where strangers say Hello on the street.  A place that isn't over run with the homeless.  Most importantly, a place where life is a little more relaxed.

Once again, the thoughts of running my own studio have drifted back into my mind.  It is pretty much a given that at some point I will end up working for myself or starting a company either myself or with others I know and would love to work with again.  Being a low paid cog in a multibillion dollar machine can be a little depressing at times.

Enough of that, time for some pictures!

In addition to the Market, the view and the farms; we also found a great little restaurant.  The kind of place we wish we could find around where we live.  If you are ever in Ganges on Salt Spring Island I whole heartedly recommend that you should stop by <a href="http://www.saltspringtourism.com/business/search_results_details.asp?memID=92475309&catID=188&SearchType=&txtKeywords=&CurrentPage=1">Auntie Pesto's</a> (their homepage is under construction, so this is a link to the Salt Spring Island Chamber of Commerce site that has the pertinent details for the restaurant) for a bite to eat.  I have never encountered such a perfect balance of quality, portion size and value.  It was so good, we went twice and nearly trekked our way there for a third round with their menu.

And now it is time for a couple of days of dedicated gaming before making the return to the grind.
