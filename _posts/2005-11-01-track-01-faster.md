We live in a microwavable world.  Everything needs to be faster and more poweful.  For some reason this is conventionally seen as better.

Cars need to move faster.  Everything needs to be more effecient.  You need to be able to have everything on demand.  You can pause live TV because it&apos;s recording itself!  The world wants everything and it wants everything now.  Food needs to have instructions for cooking in the oven or on the stovetop in 20-45 minutes and 3 minute microwave instructions.  Cellphones are everywhere, because what if someone called right now and you weren&apos;t there?  How could the world possibly continue turning without that instant connection?

Impatience rules all.

One thing I&apos;ve noticed that gets especially strange as you get older is dating.  When you are young, dating is a wonderful adventure.  You smile at her, she smiles at you.  After some digging deep inside for that ounce of courage you start a conversation.  You keep smiling at eachother.  Soon you&apos;re going out for a movie, drinks, dinner, coffee.  You start to spend more and more time together.  You explore eachother with words, looks, touches.  Everyday you learn something new and wonderful.  You move forward through life together enjoying the moment, living for it; searching to see if there is something deep and special between you.

Once you hit a certain age though it becomes very different.  You meet someone.  You go out for dinner.  Instead of the conversation being "Have you been here?  What do you like to do?  You like what music?  Which movies?  If I had known you didn&apos;t like Indian food we could have gone somewhere else..." to "Do you want to have kids?  If so, how many? What do you want out of this relationship?  Are you ready to settle down?  How important is family to you?"  Dating becomes an interview for a position rather than an adventure of the organic evolution of friendship and love between two people.

Now the lyrics of this song happen to choose the medium of sex to explore this concept of a world that is all about everything being faster.  It throws some interestingly deep lines into the mix as well though.  Lines that tell of the depths beyond the shallows.

"It&apos;s always the fallen ones I think are going to save me"

I&apos;ve often thought that myself.  Well, maybe not that they would save me.  I&apos;ve always been attracted to the fallen ones though.  I believe it&apos;s because I fell.  From up on high to way down low.  

I still think there is hope for everyone and everything.  I think that you can save yourself by saving someone else.  It&apos;s the experience of the effort, the dedication, the selflessness of always being there for them.  I think that tunes in to something deep inside of someone fallen and starts to wake them up.  It resonates within them like a tuning fork.  Each pulse of goodness they put out into the world echoes and vibrates within them.  It raises them and brightens them.  Maybe that&apos;s why some people seem to glow.  Maybe that&apos;s how some people seem to fly.

It brings hope.  Yeah hope.  You remember?  That self-destructive weapon from yesterday.

That&apos;s all for today.  Please tune in tomorrow for the next installment in this adventure "Blinded".

I will leave you with this great quote.  I give credit to  for turning me to the quotes of this author.

"Life is not orderly. No matter how we try to make life so, right in the middle of it we die, lose a leg, fall in love, drop a jar of applesauce." ~ Natalie Goldberg
