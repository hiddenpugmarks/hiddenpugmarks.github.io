Name.  Iris.  Let Love In.  The Goo Goo Dolls have some great songs, and I'm going to go see them live next month :)  The day after that I'm going to go see The Tragically Hip.  Let the music flow.

The music "scene" is weird here in Vancouver.  There is a lot less music than you will find in say, Montreal.  However, a lot more of the better known bands play in Vancouver.  It seems that there is a lot more punk and alternative music that comes out of Vancouver, but there is more rock that comes out of Montreal.

Interestingly enough, and completely unrelated, the Hell's Angels' presence is equally strong in both cities.

The homeless presence is much more prevalent in Vancouver.  Of course, it's much warmer out here than in Montreal.  I've been told that as winter approaches the homeless from Montreal will migrate out this way.  I've also heard rumours that as the olympics approach that the homeless will be pushed out of the downtown area.  Maybe they'll put up a wall around Hastings and Main..?

I hear just as much english spoken out on the street in Vancouver as I heard in Montreal, that means very little.  The difference is that in Montreal it was almost always French that I heard.  Out here there a dozen major Asian and South-East Asian dialects floating around.

Well, I think I'm all out of completely random thoughts for the moment.  Happy Nearly Halloween Everyone!
