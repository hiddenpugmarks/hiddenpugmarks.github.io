Touching you tenderly
Wiping away your tears
Brushing back your hair
Searching for your smile
Hidden behind your trembling lips
I want to calm them with a kiss
How can I push away the clouds
So dark and heavy
The ones that he covered you in
So that the world can see you
As bright as I do
So that you can see your light
Reflected in my eyes
But we aren&apos;t like that
We never have been
I doubt you will ever let us be
I gently kiss each bruise
Telling you that everything will be okay
Silently counting how many times I will kill him
If I ever see him without you
My hand slips around yours
You lay back on the couch
Starting to flirt with sleep
I touch your shoulder and smile
Trying to make you feel safe
I watch your eyes flutter closed
Like soft butterfly wings
I sit there with you and watch you sleep
The moth protecting the butterfly
The Beast defending his Beauty
You are so delicate and indestructable
I hope to always be your sanctuary
