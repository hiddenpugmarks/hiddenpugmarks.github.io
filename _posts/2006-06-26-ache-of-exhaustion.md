Yesterday there was adventuring.  Foley and I headed out to the mountains.  We drove up through Capsilano to Grouse Mountain.

We stopped at the Capsilano Bridge thinking we might check it out, but $27 seemed like a bit much to walk on a suspension bridge.  So we got back into the car and headed on up to Grouse Mountain.

When we got to Grouse Mountain we briefly looked at the gondolas heading up the mountain and thought it looked cool... but did it look $30 cool?  Not yesterday.  Then we thought we might hit up one of the hiking trails.

We headed up one of the trails, but I decided I didn't feel up to climbing such a steep hill on such a hot day. (Also weighing in the factors that I hadn't eaten yet that day and we didn't have an fluids along with us)

So we ventured forth for food.  We picked up some pretty terrible sandwiches at a convenience store and headed over the Capsilano Dam to take in the sights.  It was a beautiful view.  Looking over the cool blue lake with the snow capped mountains in the background and the parasailers coming down from Grouse Mountain.

Then we headed out across the damn and along one of the many hiking trails.  We went, and went, and went.  Lots of up and down.  We ran into many people out there doing the same thing.  Eventually we turned up a steep hill, got to the top and found a map of the trails.

Looking at the map we realized that the trail didn't loop around like we thought it did. It was just a massively long trail.  So we started the two hour hike back along the trail.  It wasn't nearly as interesting the second time.

After four hours of hiking I was exhausted!  Absolutley exhausted!  I ache all over today.  I am now aware of muscles in places that I didn't even think had muscles.  It's that good ache though.  That ache that makes you aware that you pushed yourself and you are getting stronger and healthier.

I have missed that healthy ache in my muscles.  I hope that it might be time to bring it back.  I guess I'll see how this week goes.  If it goes well, then next month I'll return to my old habits of working out three or more days a week.

Some pictures.  Not bad for a two year old camera in a cell phone:
