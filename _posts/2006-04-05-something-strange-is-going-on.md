I got my place today.  The lease is signed.  The damage deposit has been paid.  I can't wait to move in.  I should be moving in on the 13th hopefully :)

I can't believe I got it.  I really can't seem to believe anything any more.  Moving out to Vancouver just seems to have been the right thing to do.  Everything seems to be going well.  I find myself randomly smiling all day long.  I love turning around at my desk and looking at the mountains.

The work is interesting.  Vancouver is wonderful.  My apartment is great.  The location is unbelievable.

I was wandering around my new neighbourhood a bit today, and I just absolutely love it.

I walk out of my building and turn to the right and there is a grocery store.  Just past that is a movie theatre.  A little down the street is a Denny's.   Across from that I can get gourmet hot chocolate and fresh baked pastries.  The Sky Train is something like 500m away.  There's a huge HMV nearby to feed my music cravings.  There must be half a gazillion restaurants within a three block radius.  And!  And!  I can get a 10 Mbps internet connection!

I don't know what to do when things go this well.  It just doesn't happen in my life.
