Mere days and I will be leaving on a jet plane to the far off east.  No, not Asia.  Asia is actually the near west where I live.

Thanksgiving back home with the family.  It should be a good trip.  Holly will finally get to meet my family and they will finally get to meet her.  

If only there was a way to skip the flight.  I hate being stuck in a seat with nowhere to go and not much to do for endless hours.  Wandering around airports during layovers sucks too.  Especially at Pearson, which has to be the world's most boring airport.

If I haven't finished Phantom by then, then at least I'll get a chance to do just that.  Although I only have a couple hundred pages left and Friday is mighty far away at this point.

Perhaps my shiny new 80Gb iPod Video will be able to whisk away the hours as I watch some of my favourite movies.  Maybe the music will be able to lull me into a state of slumbering goodness.  If all else fails... Gravol and warm milk! (blech)
