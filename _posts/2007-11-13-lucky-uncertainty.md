The waiting and the uncertainty always weigh heavily upon me.  Being a seeker of knowledge and information, living in a state of not knowing and not being able to find out is difficult.  The fact that I have been exhausted for the last couple of weeks doesn't help.

The world needs to slow down.  Great things take time.

Holly has been amazingly patient, supportive and understanding.  I love you Holly!

Christmas is fast approaching.  I can't wait to be home for a few days.  It seems like forever since I was last there.  It will be amazing to see what has changed and what has stayed the same.

It has been another hectic year in the making so far.  Sometimes I can't believe all of the things that have happened throughout the course of my life.  I've been to so many places, met so many people, and done so many things.  Sometimes it can feel like nothing ever happens, but when you stop and look at it, a whole lot has.

I am a very lucky person in a lot of ways.
