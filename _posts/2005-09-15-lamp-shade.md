I&apos;m good for you
In a broken way
Like when a lamp shade shatters
It&apos;s the light that matters
Everything is torn apart
In the beat of a desperate heart
The pieces won&apos;t go back together
You just sweep up the glass dust
Live with the bare light
Build some new trust
I used to be one of your heroes
From everything to nothing
In far less than zero
Faster than light
I was supporting you
You were fixing me
It was working so well for us
Or at least I thought it was
I really am good for you
In a broken way
You&apos;re right for me
In too many ways
You scare me
Or maybe I&apos;m just afraid of what you offer
Now with the lamp shade broken
The shadows are gone
Pure light has burned away our illusions
Maybe it&apos;s just me
But I&apos;m slowly filling with confusion
To steal a line from a favourite song
I never felt alone until I met you
The bright colours have all faded
The world is monochromatic blue
Everything feels so cold without you
You made everything feel like a dream
My beautiful bed, so soft and wonderful
That place that used to be a haven
It barely gets used anymore
I sleep on the couch most nights
My bed is made for two
It feels so empty without you
I am good for you
In a broken way
Maybe I&apos;m bad for you too
In a broken way
Or maybe I&apos;m not and I can&apos;t see it
Maybe we need to find a new lamp shade
To make things like they used to be
Or maybe I&apos;m just broken
