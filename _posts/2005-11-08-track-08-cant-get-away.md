This is a song about the way the lead singer of 3eb felt after he and Charlize Theron broke up.  It&apos;s about how he could never get away from her.  She was everywhere.  On magazines in stores, on tvs, everywhere.  While this was a literal problem for him, I think we all feel this same thing after a relationship ends poorly.

It&apos;s the way that you can&apos;t get away from love.  Again, I&apos;ll go back to they way I feel and understand love, it isn&apos;t physical or solid.

After a relationship ends that you aren&apos;t ready to let go of you see that other person everywhere.  Every single thing will remind you of them.  The scent of her shampoo lingering on the pillow case.  The emptiness beside you on the bed.  The volume of e-mail you don&apos;t receive any more.  The loss of the candles and thoughtful letters.  That soft smile greeting you when your eyes flutter open the days first light.

You walk out into the city.  You see their favourite restaurant.  Their favourite book store.  Their favourite cake shop.  You see their friends and hangouts.  You see so many things that used to be amazing that now seem to be lacking because they aren&apos;t there with you.

The waking hours are longer.  The sleeping hours are shorter.  The dreams are stranger.  You are sadder.  

It just takes time.  There is no quick fix.  Even though they aren&apos;t there you just can&apos;t get away from them.  Eventually most things will go back to normal.  If the feelings were strong and pure though, certain things will always remind you of them.  There is nothing you can do to get around those things.

There are still things years later that I miss about some women that have passed through my life.  Things that will never fade.  I think that&apos;s a good thing though.  It means that those relationships were important and special.

I still love all of them in a different way.

Tune in tomorrow for "Wake for Young Souls."
