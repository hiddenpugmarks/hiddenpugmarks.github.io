I would like to share with you the efficiency of the Canadian Postal system.  The following is the shipping status of Holly's Birthday present:

|Date|Time|Location|Event Details|
|-|-|-|-|
|Feb 3 2008|07:53:00|AM MISSISSAUGA ON CA|---|
|Jan 25 2008|04:38:00|PM MISSISSAUGA ON CA|---|
|Jan 25 2008|01:45:00|PM MISSISSAUGA ON CA|---|

That makes it 11 days that the package has been sitting in that warehouse.  They've moved it around a few times, but it still hasn't left.

It had an original delivery estimate of February 1st.  Clearly they failed.

I have had an insane day.  I've been running around the studio like a chicken with its head cut off putting out fire after fire.  Memory problem here, replay snafu there, weirdness everywhere.

I still have a ton of my own work to get to.

Honestly, I do have to say that it is nice to be busy though.  It keeps me a lot more focused and a lot more motivated.
