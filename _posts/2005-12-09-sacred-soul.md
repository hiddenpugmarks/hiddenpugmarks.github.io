Questing for the sacred soul.  Seeking that one that matches so divinely.  The broken pieces that fit with mine to form a wondrous thing.  Slivers of hope and shards of heart stirred together with flecks of tears and shavings of dreams with zest of loyalty.  

Where are you?  Why aren&apos;t you here?

I remember when we met.  It was back in &apos;72.  In the cosmic soup of time before life.  It was by that diner on the corner of 22nd and Destiny Street.  You know the place?  With the rainbow of floating dreams and the pancakes that make you feel like you&apos;re eating clouds?

I still remember the way you smiled from so deep inside.  We hit it off so wonderfully.  We spent so much time together.

We were pre-life and we felt like gods.  It got boring though.  I guess almost everything always does.  Late one fateful night we decided to go for it.  Mortality.  The chance to live and die and feel things in ways that we couldn&apos;t as we were.

We never saw each other again after that.  We promised that we would find each other.  They scheduled me for &apos;79.  I have no idea when you might have arrived.

I remember the face of your heart.  I hope you remember the face of mine.  I hope that when we cross paths that we aren&apos;t too jaded by life and let each other slip by like strangers on the street.

I&apos;ve looked everywhere for you but I still haven&apos;t been able to find you.  So I&apos;m staying here for a while.  Here in the chaotic human wave that is Montreal.

I&apos;m here.  Come and find me.
