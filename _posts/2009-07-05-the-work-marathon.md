Somewhere along the way towards our fourth milestone, and then alpha, life started getting a little fuzzy.  I was at work for 28 out of 31 days there at one point.  The worst thing is that on a team of close to 40, there were only 7-10 of us there getting things done.

That kind of situation is never good for team morale.

Regardless, that period is behind us now.  I am now on the last day of a three day weekend and I am finally starting to feel like a normal human being again.  I know the push to all of the milestones between now and beta will be tough, but at least we won't be getting heaps of new features piled on us.

Alpha to Beta is one of my favourite parts of a project.  It is the home stretch of the project.  The point at which you are just fixing bugs.  Grinding away at them until you finally hit zero and then scrambling to keep them at zero.

As much as I do enjoy this part of the project, I really can't wait for the whole thing to be pushed out the door.
