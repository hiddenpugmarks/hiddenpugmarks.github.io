Supposedly this song, according to most people, is about doing heroin or other drugs.  Some people say that it&apos;s about sex.

I can see those references and and I can see reasoning behind those statements, but to me that isn&apos;t what it&apos;s about.  It uses those thing as metaphors and avenues for explanation.

I see it as about being in a relationship.  One of those relationships that people don&apos;t approve of, for whatever reason.  It&apos;s that feeling of a double standard when you are with someone and your friends can&apos;t understand it, but it&apos;s perfectly fine for them to date whoever they want.

It&apos;s about the stress that a situation like that puts on the relationship.  It&apos;s about that terrible discussion of where you try to get across that you want to keep working at the relationship and you hope that they do too.  It&apos;s about looking at the person and being able to tell them from the heart that they are the only thing that&apos;s real in the world.

Tune in tomorrow for "Company"
