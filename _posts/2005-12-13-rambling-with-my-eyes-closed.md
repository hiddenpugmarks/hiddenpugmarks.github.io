I closed my eyes and typed every word that came out.  I guess that makes this stream-of-consciousness poetry.

catch me
I&apos;m falling
touch me
I&apos;m fading
feel me
before I disappear
make me
be solid again
save me
make me real
I don&apos;t know
how to change
I want to
I want to end these games
so touch me
before I fade away
maybe you&apos;ll save me
maybe I will fall anyway
at least
we will know
the way it all works
why the pain grows
there has to be
so much more
here for us
before the storm
I can&apos;t
keep on pretending
that I don&apos;t
love you
like the morning
and the rainbows
I can&apos;t 
pretend that
I hate you
that I&apos;m crying for her
when the salty tears
are falling from my eyes
like raindrops
falling form saddened skies
and they&apos;re falling for you
falling for us
for all of this
broken trust
I just
want to love you
to love you
to be loved by you
my heart
is open
and beating
and bloodfilled
my heart
is growing
it&apos;s strengthening
for the fall
that comes with fading
please touch me
I need to feel you
I need to feel me
instead of feeling this
I can&apos;t rest
no matter what I do
I can&apos;t stop the voices
no matter what I think
I just want
to crawl
right out
of my skin
and see what
is there 
beating within
so touch me
I&apos;m fading
I&apos;m about to fall
I&apos;m raining
my soul
my heart
all of me
every part
the emotions and feelings
the cosmic dealings
they are ending now
I can&apos;t seem to find
my way out 
of this rat trap
of this horrible
place I&apos;m at
I&apos;m falling
I&apos;m fading
I&apos;m breaking
no, I&apos;m broken
I don&apos;t know where
to go from here
I just want to feel
solid and real
like a wooden boy
that&apos;s been made to feel
and his painted tears
are falling for real
so help me
save me
is that too much to ask
am I really worth so little
when you mean
the world to me
every single thing
I taste your words
with every breath
and I feel your skin
in the kiss of the winter wind
as it brushes me
like a boy, not a man
I can only feel you
inside of me, outside of me
somewhere I cannot see
let&apos;s hop into the car
let&apos;s drive to where we are
like we used to do
when we loved wildly
in our youth
come on baby
come to me
I&apos;ve always been here
and I always will be
I can&apos;t move on
when the best thing is behind me
I can&apos;t be strong
when you&apos;ve given up on me
so touch me
before I fade away
feel me
make me real
change this clay to flesh
change this wood to bone
make me whole
