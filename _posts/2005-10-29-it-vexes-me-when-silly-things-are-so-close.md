|<b>Your Personality Is</b>|
|<strong>Rational (NT)</strong>|

You are both logical and creative. You are full of ideas.
You are so rational that you analyze everything. This drives people a little crazy!

Intelligence is important to you. You always like to be around smart people.
In fact, you&apos;re often a little short with people who don&apos;t impress you mentally.

You seem distant to some - but it&apos;s usually because you&apos;re deep in thought.
Those who understand you best are fellow Rationals.

In love, you tend to approach things with logic. You seek a compatible mate - who is also very intelligent.

At work, you tend to gravitate toward idea building careers - like programming, medicine, or academia.

With others, you are very honest and direct. People often can&apos;t take your criticism well.

As far as your looks go, you&apos;re coasting on what you were born with. You think fashion is silly.

On weekends, you spend most of your time thinking, experimenting with new ideas, or learning new things.
