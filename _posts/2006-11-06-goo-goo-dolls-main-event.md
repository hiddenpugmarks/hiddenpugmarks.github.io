The Goo Goo Dolls definitely delivered last night.  It was an early Sunday night show and they still delivered a great show.  One of the great quotes from the night, while Johnny was interacting with a heckler in the crowd was "If you want me to take off my pants, come back on a Friday or Saturday show!"

The first thing about the show that came across as extremely amazing was the diversity of the crowd.  There were people there from the age of 10 all the way up to probably early 50s.  The GGDs just have a sound that appeals to everyone.  They have a gift for lyrics and catchy hooks.

The show started with a tremendous bang.  There was complete darkness one moment and the next the guitar and bass players were jumping in the air and hammering down on their instruments as the lights flashed on.  Every concert should start like that.  The band just completely throwing themselves into the show.

Admittedly other than the entrance, the fist song was a little week.  The band had to warm up to it a bit.  From that point on though it was fantastic.  Everyone was out of their seats for the whole night (the current throbbing pain in my feet can attest to that).

During "Black Balloon", black balloons started filtering forward through the audience.  The crowd kept them bouncing through the air, slowly up onto the stage.

I think the only real downer of the night, is that it wasn't a sell out; or rather it was a sell out, but the scalpers didn't sell all of their tickets.  Row 4 was essentially empty.

It was a fantastic show and I'm glad I got to go.  The GGDs haven't toured Canada in four years, and it's hard to say when they might pass through again.

I give the Goo Goo Dolls a solid 8/10.
