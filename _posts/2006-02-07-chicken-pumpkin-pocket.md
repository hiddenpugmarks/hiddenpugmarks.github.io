Today it arrived!  At long last, after trying to get it since Christmas, it finally arrived.  I have my nice shiny new copy of Paper Wings by Cauterize.  No longer will I have to undergo the torturne of the 128kbs encoding of the version I bought from iTunes.

Tonight when I get home it will be ripped in all of it&apos;s lossless audio glory and the songs will find their way back into heavy rotation on my playlists.  

I had tried to get it at the music stores around Montreal.  I had tried to buy it from eBay.  I had tried to buy it from the sites their website said it was available from.  I got very close a little over a month ago when it was available on a website, but by the time I got the cart checkout it was sold out.  Then on a lark I was checking the same site from work a week ago and it was listed.  So I hurried the hell up and ordered it.

I&apos;ve been doing this whole thing recently where I take risks.  Like recently when I tried an El Salvadorian restaurant and found that I really enjoyed Papusas and Plaintains aren&apos;t bad either. 

Today I tried a Guayanese(sp?) restaurant.  I ended up with a "chicken pumpkin pocket".  There was also a "goat pumpkin pocket" available, but hey, one risk at a time :p  Overall it was pretty good.  Inoffensive.  It was exceptionally filling.  I swear that there was a whole chicken and half a pumpkin stuffed in that pocket along with some other vegetables.

When a friend suggested the restaurant I was imagining a much smaller "pocket" in my mind.  This thing was about 8 inches by 10 inches and 1.5-2 inches thick.  I didn&apos;t manage to eat it all before it was time to get back to work.

Will I go back?  It&apos;s uncertain at this point.  I think knowing what to expect going into it I would consider it to be a really good meal.  I had had my heart set on two eggs over easy, three strips of bacon, two slices of toast with strawberry jam, some pan fries, a coffe and an orange juice for lunch though.  So my taste buds didn&apos;t exactly get what they had been anticipating.

Now, I just want to go home and smite me some trolls!
