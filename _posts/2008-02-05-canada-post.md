I would like to share with you the efficiency of the Canadian Postal system.  The following is the shipping status of Holly's Birthday present:

<table border=1>
<tr><td>Date</td><td>Time</td><td>Location</td><td>Event Details</td></tr>
<tr><td>Feb 3 2008</td><td>07:53:00</td><td>AM MISSISSAUGA ON CA</td><td>---</td></tr>
<tr><td>Jan 25 2008</td><td>04:38:00</td><td>PM MISSISSAUGA ON CA</td><td>---</td></tr>
<tr><td>Jan 25 2008</td><td>01:45:00</td><td>PM MISSISSAUGA ON CA</td><td>---</td></tr>
</table>

That makes it 11 days that the package has been sitting in that warehouse.  They've moved it around a few times, but it still hasn't left.

It had an original delivery estimate of February 1st.  Clearly they failed.

I have had an insane day.  I've been running around the studio like a chicken with its head cut off putting out fire after fire.  Memory problem here, replay snafu there, weirdness everywhere.

I still have a ton of my own work to get to.

Honestly, I do have to say that it is nice to be busy though.  It keeps me a lot more focused and a lot more motivated.
