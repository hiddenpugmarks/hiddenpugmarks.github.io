Today, Holly and I are celebrating our one month anniversary.  Half of me can hardly believe that we have been together for a full month, the other half can hardly believe that we have only been together for one month.

Hopefully the weather will cooperate with us and we can head back to the same beach we went to on our first date.  Right now it is looking pretty grey outside though.  The clouds seem heavy with rain.

I'm looking forward to everyone getting to meet Holly over Thanksgiving.  Tentatively looking to fly in on October 6th and fly back out on the 9th or 10th.
