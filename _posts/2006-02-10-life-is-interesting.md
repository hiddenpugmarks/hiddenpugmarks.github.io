Life is interesting.  Every single day of it.  The good ones, and even the bad ones.

I know, that unlike a lot of people, I can find the silver lining in almost any cloud.  I can also definitely spot the bad apple in a barrel as well.  My mood is the determining factor in which of those things I then present to everyone else.

Lately I haven't been sleeping much.  I just can't seem to find time for it.  The side effect of this, is that my body is starting to make time for it.  I consistently fall asleep in the bath or shower these days.  If I flop on the couch to watch a few sports highlights, I generally wake up hours later.  

Last weekend I was getting ready to do laundry, I had the bag full and ready to go.  I was sitting on the edge of my bed when I leaned back for just a second to think and make sure that I had everything.  I woke up three hours later, and the laundry didn't get done that day.

I even find myself struggling to stay awake when I'm riding the subway.  It's hot down there.  The subway constantly vibrates.  The white noise sound of moving through the tunnels is very relaxing.

I guess this is the onset of <a href="http://www.shuteye.com/glossary.asp">narcolepsy</a>.

So what's the cause you might ask?  No one knows.  It's just something that happens.  It has happened all my life in spurts here and there.  My last year of high school, I swear, I barely ever slept.  I've spent months on end at a time plagued by nightmares.  I've spent the larger portion of my life living on 4-6 hours of sleep.

I'm convinced that the crux of the problem is that I'm supposed to sleep my eight hours a night from 4am until noon.  Society won't let me do that though, and keep the job that I have.  Working from noon until 8pm or 9pm sounds just fine to me.

Even after it all though, I find myself smiling.  I was taking a cab to work today, driving through the same streets as always.  I was looking at the same buildings that I always see.  Something though was wonderful.  I re-realized that I live in Montreal and this is a wonderful city!  I still can't believe I'm here sometimes.  I come from such small town roots.

It helped to lift away the tired feeling that has wrapped itself so tightly around me.

Hopefully I won't fall asleep in Blackwing Lair tonight.  There's a Broodlord in there, and he needs to do some dying.
